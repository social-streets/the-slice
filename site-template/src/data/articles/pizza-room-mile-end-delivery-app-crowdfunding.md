[The Pizza Room](https://romanroadlondon.com/pizza-room-delivery-app-launch-party/), winner of Time Out’s ‘Best Pizza in Bow’ award, needs your help to crowdfund their very own delivery app.

The Pizza Room owner, Pam, started a Kickstarter campaign in order to bypass mainstream food delivery apps, many of which take a large cut from the total order value (up to 35%) to cover their costs. This means your pizza arrives colder and more expensive than Pam would like.

Help her cut out the Silicon Valley middleman.

‘Delivery is the only aspect of our service that is out of our control,’ says Pam. ‘We want to take back that control to offer you an even better experience, smooth from order to delivery, quicker and cheaper.’

The Pizza Room needs £5,000 to develop their own delivery app. There are different rewards for each donation. Some of the rewards include: pledge £15 or more and receive a pizza; £50 or more receive two three-course dinners with wine and your name on the Wall of Fame; or pledge £600 and receive four bottles of prosecco, have your name engraved on their table, a private party for 25 and a pizza named after you.

Pam opened the Pizza Room in 2014, which now prides itself on being more than just a pizzeria: ‘We are a community hub for pizza lovers across London.’ Their dough is proven for 72 hours and their toppings are carefully selected from suppliers in Italy.

Vegetables are bought from local traders at Spitalfields market everyday, and every pizza is prepared on site.

‘Being part of the community is as important as baking excellent pizza,’ says Pam. ‘That's why we donate all the time we can to local events, we support local initiatives and we support the schools around us. Because children love pizza, and we love children!’

The Pizza Room wants to make sure the East End community is getting the pizza they love, without third-party delivery apps and Silicon Valley tech companies. What's not to love.
