Ah yes, the timeless question. Where can I watch the game? We've revisited the the best places in Bow and Globe Town to watch sport. From the cosy darkness of the Young Prince to the four screens at The Crown, the area can serve up every type of viewing experience.

## Young Prince

### 448 Roman Rd, E3 5LU

This Roman Road staple has one screen tucked away in its darkest depths, so if you want to watch the rugby with absolute concentration and a pint of bitter, this old-school boozer might just be the place for you. They have a lovely beer garden as well, so there's somewhere to clear your head if the dreadful performances are getting a little too much.

**Particularly good for...** cosy, quiet spectating

## Morgan Arms

### 43 Morgan St, E3 5AA

This is a classic East End pub. The Morgan Arms was founded in 1839 and the current building has stood since 1892. It has pivoted to a more gastro pub vibe in recent years, making its family-friendly atmosphere an excellent option for watching matches with your kids. They’ll be showing every game, and are looking forward to seeing sports lovers back in the pub standing with a pint in hand.

## The Eleanor Arms

### 460 Old Ford Rd, E3 5JP

[The Eleanor Arms](https://romanroadlondon.com/eleanor-arms-pub/) is one of our favourites and is a good bet for rugby season. The community-centric atmosphere lends itself to a fun viewing experience and although there's no food, you'll forget your hunger pretty quickly as you get absorbed into the ambience. If you come to a match on Sunday then it's well worth sticking around for some live jazz. How many pubs can offer rugby _and_ jazz?

**Particularly good for...** community atmosphere (and jazz)

## Green Goose

### 112 Anglo Rd, E3 5HD

Ever since its renovation in 2016, the [Green Goose](https://www.greengooselondon.com/) has become one of the most-loved pubs in the area. During sport season, it has two screens in picture perfect position so you can see the game from wherever you’re sat. Sometimes, it even has a projector in the beer garden, so you don’t miss a second.

**Particularly good for...** Rugby, a pint, and a hearty meal

## The Lord Morpeth

### 402 Old Ford Rd, E3 5NR

Eating a delicious sourdough pizza while watching the game? Sounds pretty good to us. Head to the Lord Morpeth to see matches in super-size, blown up on a projector. The Morpeth isn't an out-and-out sports pub, so it's a great fit if you prefer to watch the Six Nations over a martini instead of a pint.

**Particularly good for...** watching Rugby with your pinky finger sticking out

## The Crown

### 223 Grove Rd, E3 5SN

The Crown has a big selection of screens so that no one will miss out on a good viewing spot. Find three screens downstairs and one upstairs in a private room that is available for hire. Their craft beer game is particularly good, and during Six Nations matches they provide a free round of Guinness for all diners who book in advance to watch the game. Sharing boards of mini beef burgers or ribs are a Six Nations special for groups of three or more at £10.95 per person. Pretty good going.

**Particularly good for...** sit-down viewing and private bookings

## Lord Tredegar

### 50 Lichfield Rd, E3 5AL

If, against all odds, it's sunny, the Lord Tredegar might be your best bet for game day. The covered outdoor area and huge screen lend themselves to outdoor viewing, while the burgers are some of the best around. If, as is likely, the weather is miserable, the Lord Tredegar has one of the cosiest interiors around. Its pristine Victorian interior is a lovely setting to soak in some sport - and locally brewed beer.

**Particularly good for...** outdoor viewing and comfortable afternoons

## The Coborn

### 8 Coborn Rd, E3 2DA

The Coborn will be showing all Six Nations matches on their two screens. The pub accepts bookings for matches, and if you decide to dine with them they’ll throw in a round of Guinness on the house. There’s a good buzz here but matches aren’t too rowdy, so you can enjoy their sticky chicken and rib sharers with friends and family while you watch.

**Particularly good for...** quality pub grub with family.

## The Florist Arms

### 255 Globe Rd, E2 0JD

The Florist Arms is one of our favourite pubs in Globe Town, and although there is only one screen, the pub is small and everyone will get a good view of the TV. The Florist is running an ale special through February. Every Sunday and Monday all ales are half price so you won’t have to worry about breaking the bank and celebrating each scrum. 

**Particularly good for...** chilled sports viewing

## The Camel

### 277 Globe Rd, E2 0JD

![](/images/the-camel-pub.jpg)

The Camel is a local favourite and a relaxing place to watch matches. The only scrums here will be on the screens. If you really want an East End boozer experience it's hard to look past the pie menu here. Rugby and pie? Bloody marvellous. Get there early, as space is limited and fills up quickly.

**Particularly good for...** pie & mash & rugby

## Angel & Crown

### 170 Roman Road, E2 0RY

After its refurbishment in 2019, Globe Town’s Angel & Crown has taken on a new lease of life. The pub has retained its familiar baby-blue exterior and traditional dark wood furnishings while transforming itself into an inclusive community pub. They’ll be showing every Six Nations game and are inviting families, sports fans and everyone in between to come and watch.

**Particularly good for...** catching the game with your neighbour
