Tower Hamlets has been awarded ‘Tree Cities of the World’ status for the second year in a row, pledging to plant 1,000 new trees in the next three years.

Whether you know your oak from your ash and your spruce from your sycamore, you might have noticed the newly-planted trees lining the streets of East London. 

Tower Hamlets was awarded ‘Trees Cities of the World’ status for the second year in a row in April 2023. Our borough joins the 168 cities from 21 countries around the world to be recognised this year for the tree-planting efforts of local charities and the Council. 

Since being recognised last year, over 3,000 new trees have been planted on streets and in parks, increasing biodiversity and expanding community forestry across the borough. 

Trees for Cities charity has hosted planting events for local volunteers, planting 100 new trees in [Victoria Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/), 50 in Weavers Fields, and 12 in Bethnal Green Gardens. 

In order to deliver on the Mayor’s pledge to plant 1,000 new trees over the next three years, Tower Hamlets has become one of the first councils in the UK to partner with Trees for Streets. 

Through the partnership, local residents and organisations have sponsored over 200 trees across the borough which help to reduce air pollution, absorb carbon and improve [our urban environment](https://romanroadlondon.com/news/environment/). 

Tower Hamlets has over 120 green spaces, from small pocket parks to award-winning Victoria Park which holds the Green Flag People’s Choice award as one of the top 10 parks in the UK.
