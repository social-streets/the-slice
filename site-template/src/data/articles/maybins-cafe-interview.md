Although it opened only last year, Maybin's has fast become one of Roman Road's go-to cafes for East End locals and newbies alike. 

Mother and daughter team, Sheree and Carly Maybin, set up the cafe when they had the chance to buy the lease from the old owners, Barone. Maybin explains that 'We didn't really change much about the way it looked. We gutted the kitchen and cleaned up, but that was it.'

The new cafe slid easily into the already-existing community on the Roman and Maybin thinks it was for a number of reasons. 'Nothing changed that much except the food got better. I've also lived in the area for my whole life, so I know everyone and that definitely helped when we opened.'

Mum Sheree loves every aspect of owning and running a cafe. 'I used to be a publican, so it's all very familiar to me' she explains. Sheree is adept at talking to people, and the growing crowd of loyal customers don't need to tell her their order when they walk through the door.

Maybin arrived home from travelling around Bali last year, and her experiences there helped shaped the menu into what it is today. Think hangover-busting smoothies made with banana, spinach, avocado, kiwi and spirulina. Or for food, try their gluten-free potatoes, spinach, mushrooms and feta breakfast salad, with two poached eggs.

[Balinese-style smoothie bowls](https://romanroadlondon.com/maybins-balinese-smoothie-bowls-recipe/) have been a hit for breakfast, and Maybin explains why, 'Super-charged with goodness, our vitality bowls are the new breakfast trend everyone is whizzing up. Inspired by Bali, they get your taste buds buzzing and give you a nutritional health kick to your morning. Get that vitamin C boost you need to rev up your immune system after a hard weekend.'

‘Along with the fact they are filled to the brim with antioxidants, the smoothie bowls also have superfood ingredients which are incredibly high in protein and B-vitamins. For fussy eaters, there are dairy free options, gluten free (without the granola). Or perhaps for you classic meat eaters, it’s a change from the morning fry up or a bacon sarnie.

Maybin's appeals to old East Enders, market traders, teenagers and newcomers alike. Maybin explains, 'We want to appeal to everyone, but we're trying to maintain a classy vibe, with good food, rather than a greasy spoon. We want to keep everything affordable, but high quality, so we go to markets like Smithfield to get our produce.'

At the moment, Sheree and Carly are working on expanding their organic tea and coffee range and organising a license which means they can stay open later. Their plans for the future? Watch this space for evening opening hours and all kinds of new drinks...
