**Pergola on the Wharf**

Covered in greenery, Pergola on the Wharf offers some contrast to its metropolitan surrounding in Canary Wharf. You will find it across from Crossrail Place roof garden which is free to visit and open daily until 9 pm. Patrons can enjoy a botanical bar experience with food and drink that is inspired by nature. A perfect place to make people jealous on Instagram, take a selfie surrounded by plants with views of the wharf. 

_For Pergola on the Wharf, visit Crossrail Pl, London E14 5AR, Floor 1 of Canary Wharf Shopping Centre._

**Lord Napier Star**

The Lord Napier was closed in 1995 and became a space for squatters and ravers. It has continually been transformed by different iterations of graffiti. This unique look made it an iconic part of our area. The pub was a [collective statement](https://romanroadlondon.com/lord-napier-pub-hackney-wick-history/) by local artists about their claim to the East End. It is still eye-catching today though it has lost some of its anti-establishmentarian charm. Nowadays, you can enjoy an experience that is slightly more refined with an Old Fashioned on its fashionable rooftop. They also offer Thai street food such as Massaman curry or chicken satay. This would make a great treat to revive you from a mid-week slump or a lively Saturday night if you’re looking for a bar with a DJ.

_To visit Lord Napier Star go to 25 White Post Ln, London E9 5ER._

**Pocketsquare Skyline Bar & Terrace** 

BEST FOR: VIEWS OF EAST LONDON

If you have a birthday or any other special occasion coming up, Pocketsquare Skyline offers beautiful views of the East End and extra special signature cocktails. One of these cocktails comes with vodka chocolate truffles and a ‘Golden Ticket’ that might see you winning a £250 prize. Located in Whitechapal and facing the East, the bar offers views of a very familiar skyline. Be proud as you look out over your home town. They also host a monthly live music night, making the venue perfect for impressing a date.

_Pocketsquare is located in Black Lion House, 45 Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU._

**Roof East**

BEST FOR: A RANGE OF FUN ACTIVITIES

If you want somewhere where you can enjoy Mexican food, drink cocktails and partake in an exciting range of activities from crazy golf to glitter bowls (it's bowls but with some sparkle), Roof East is the rooftop for you. As well as Mexican food, they offer Turkish shawarmas and burgers. If you’re at a loose end this weekend, this is the perfect excuse to spend some time with your friends and eat some delicious food.

_Roof East can be found on Floor 8, Stratford Multi-Storey Car Park, Great Eastern Way, London E15 1XE_

**Chiringuito** **\- Bethnal Green**

If you can’t get away to Spain for a holiday right now, you can still enjoy the Spanish vibe of rooftop drinks and tapas at Chiringuito in Bethnal Green. Their menu offers Catalan classics such as cocas, a flatbread from Barcelona. They also have dishes inspired by Hispanic and Latin American flavours such as their South American ceviche, a Chiringuito speciality. Though you may not be able to gaze out at the sea, Chringuito is based in the corner of Museum Gardens which also makes for a very pretty view.  

_You can find Chiringuito at Museum Gardens, Chiringuito, London E2 9PA._
