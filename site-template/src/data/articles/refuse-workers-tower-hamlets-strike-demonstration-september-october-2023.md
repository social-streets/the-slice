Ongoing pay disputes mean striking refuse workers and street cleaners in Tower Hamlets will extend the strike for another two weeks until Sunday 15 October, according to Unite the Union.

Following a stalemate with the council over pay, Tower Hamlets refuse workers demonstrated outside the Royal London Hospital on Wednesday 20 September alongside other East London public sector workers on strike.

Demonstrations by refuse workers have been occurring all week. On Tuesday 19 September, the striking workers formed a picket line in Poplar. The following day, they were joined by other striking public sector workers in an ‘East London day of action’. 

The demonstration at the Royal London Hospital began on Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. In a solidarity rally of public sector workers from Tower Hamlets, refuse workers demonstrated alongside striking members of the Barts Health NHS Trust as well as members of the [British Medical Association.](https://romanroadlondon.com/nhs-health-service-strike-september-2023-tower-hamlets/)

The demonstration involved speeches from Apsana Begum, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, Dr Anna Livingston, a retired GP for Limehouse, and regional officer for Unite the Union, Nicholas West, amongst many others.  

On Friday 8 September, over 200 refuse and street cleaners in Tower Hamlets rejected the national pay offer of a [flat rate increase of £1,925.](https://romanroadlondon.com/refuse-workers-street-cleaners-strike-pay-september-2023-tower-hamlets/) The offer is below the rate of inflation, and therefore amounts to a real terms pay cut. The workers initially announced a two-week strike, from Monday 18 September until Sunday 1 October.

Unite the Union, the UK and Ireland’s largest trade union represents the refuse workers of Tower Hamlets. Unite the Union regional officer, West, alongside other Unite representatives, met with Tower Hamlets council to negotiate a pay award on Monday 11 September. Negotiations were not successful, and no resolution occurred. 

Following unsuccessful negotiations on Monday 11 September, West confirmed that refuse workers will extend their strike action by a further two weeks, until Sunday 15 October. Members may decide to extend this date if no progress is made. 

In a statement released on the Tower Hamlets Council website, Lutfur Rahman, Executive Mayor of Tower Hamlets, said: 

‘We value our frontline staff and know how hard they work. This strike is a national pay dispute and not limited to local issues. It is in fact a response to the very real cost-of-living crisis felt by families up and down the country.’

While Tower Hamlets Council cannot change the national pay of refuse workers set by the National Joint Council (NJC), they could provide a one-off payment to the refuse workers of Tower Hamlets. 

West commented:

‘The council have turned around and said this is a national dispute which it absolutely is. But the council do have the ability to settle locally,’ said West. ‘A one-off payment might alleviate the pressure of the cost of living crisis that members find themselves in.’

In August 2022, the Mid-Ulster Council awarded workers a one-off payment of £750 above the National Pay offer. The pay offer was agreed by Unite members, ending their four-week strike action. West argues that Tower Hamlets Council has the power to award similar one-off payments to striking refuse workers in the borough.

West commented: 

‘These workers were working throughout Covid. Everyone today was working throughout Covid. We’re not asking for the world. We’re asking for fairness.’

Later the same day, refuse workers assembled once again outside the Town Hall during Wednesday’s cabinet meeting. At 4:30 p.m., refuse workers attempted to speak to the cabinet members about their working conditions and pay.  They joined a larger demonstration awaiting the Council’s decision on the removal of the [Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes in the borough.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-66872320)

Ellen, 67, is a retired nurse who joined the demonstration on Wednesday 20 September outside the Royal London Hospital. Commenting on the solidarity rally between NHS and refuse workers, she said: 

‘Our fight in the NHS is the same as the refuse workers’ fight. Our fight is their fight’. 

Unite national lead officer, Onay Kasab said:

‘Whether you’re a refuse worker, a cleaner or a doctor, decent pay and safe working are cornerstones of a fair society.’

Regarding a settlement with the Council, West said: 

‘We are in regular conversation but no offer has been presented to Unite as of this morning.’
