A man from Bow whose dog attacked police horse Urbane in Victoria Park has been convicted. 

Hakan Niyazi Candermir, 25, of Campbell Road, E3, attended Willesden Magistrates' Court on Thursday 28 September where he pleaded guilty to being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control.

He will be sentenced at the same court on a later date.

This followed an incident on Wednesday 22 March, where a dog was seized in Victoria Park after it [attacked a Met Police Horse](https://romanroadlondon.com/police-horse-dog-attack-victoria-park/) (PH) Urbane.

Officers and horses were on a routine patrol in Victoria Park when they came across Candermir, who was walking his dog.

Unprovoked, the dog began attacking the horse and Candermir was unable to control the dog or get him away from PH Urbane.

Superintendent Martin Kirby, from the Met’s Taskforce, said: ‘This very shocking event could have been easily avoided if the dog was being responsibly looked after and was on a lead.

‘Instead, Urbane was bitten by an out-of-control dog, receiving nasty injuries including tears and lacerations, while carrying out his duty.’

A member of the public was able to stop the attack by hitting the dog multiple times and then managing to get hold of the dog and move it away from PH Urbane.

It was at this point, after no attempt to help during the incident, the suspect then put the dog back on the lead.

During this attack, PH Urbane sustained eight lacerations from dog bites and needed stitches to his torso and legs after receiving wounds to his front legs, chest and underbelly.

PH Urbane spent several months recuperating at both the Met’s equestrian facility, Imber Court, and then at paddocks with the Horse Trust before being returned to [stables in Bow](https://romanroadlondon.com/bow-police-stables/).

Superintendent Kirby continued: ‘Urbane had to take several months off duty to recover from his injuries but thankfully he’s now fully recovered and back patrolling the streets of London.

‘He is generally very comfortable around dogs and we were particularly worried that this attack would affect the way he interacts with other animals. Happily, he’s just as relaxed with dogs as he’s always been.’

‘Whilst there continues to be noteworthy and sometimes tragic cases of dogs dangerously out of control in public I'm pleased to say that the majority of dog owners are responsible. This case illustrates why always having control of your dog is so important.

‘I would also praise the calm actions of PS Mann who was riding PH Urbane who dealt with a difficult situation with professionalism and fortitude.’
