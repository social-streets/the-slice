After news of Billingsgate’s closure made waves in late November, Khan is being pressured to step in as traders at the country’s largest inland fish market face an uncertain future.

The London Assembly has called on Mayor Sadiq Khan to fight to prevent the planned closure of Smithfield and Billingsgate markets.

In a letter to the Mayor, Chair of the London Assembly Planning and Regeneration Committee Andrew Boff urges Khan to meet with the City of London Corporation in a bid to reverse the decision.

If that fails, Boff on behalf of the Committee requests the Mayor works with partners to seek alternative locations for market traders.

Boff said traders face an ‘uncertain future’, and that it is ‘vital that the Mayor plays his part to rescue these markets and protect the value their businesses bring to London’.

The City of London Corporation [approved in a private meeting on November 26 to cancel a proposed relocation of Smithfield and Billingsgate markets to Dagenham.](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/plan-to-move-billingsgate-fish-market-canary-wharf-to-dagenham-axed/)

Instead, the Corporation agreed to submit a Private Bill to Parliament [to enable it to stop running both markets and to pay traders compensation to leave the sites.](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/billingsgate-fish-market-shutting-down-for-good/)

The Corporation said it will support traders to find new locations and that they will have until at least 2028 to remain at the current market sites.

The Private Bill was submitted with Parliament the following day, November 27, and is to be presented to either house in January.

The Corporation’s decision received widespread attention, with a petition calling for it to be reversed receiving more than 25,000 signatures at the time of writing.

Smithfield is the UK’s largest wholesale meat market, and Billingsgate is the country’s biggest inland fish market. Each has a history going back centuries with a market operating in Smithfield since medieval times.

In the London Assembly letter, Boff writes the Corporation’s ‘concerning’ decision has come just as the Committee has finished taking evidence as part of its investigation ‘Social value in planning and regeneration’.

‘The Committee believes the decision to close the markets fails to appreciate the immense social and cultural capital these two markets contribute to London’ he adds.

Boff further notes that the news comes only four years after planning applications were submitted to move the two markets, plus New Spitalfields at a later date, to a new purpose-built site in Dagenham.

On the Corporation’s support for traders, Boff writes the Committee is concerned this [will not prevent them ‘disappearing from London for good’.](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/billingsgate-market-traders-feel-lost-after-closure-announcement/)

He ends by offering two recommendations; that Khan seek to meet with the Chair of Policy and Resources and de-facto political leader at the City, Deputy Chris Hayward, to call for the Corporation to reverse its decision; and that if this is not successful, to work with partners to ‘urgently seek suitable alternative location \[sic\] for these two iconic London markets’.

Boff said separately: ‘Smithfield and Billingsgate markets are London’s oldest markets and are of huge importance not just to the businesses who rely on them, but to London’s rich culture and heritage.

‘The Committee has heard from businesses, industry bodies, and other experts how complex markets are – and how important it is to minimise moving businesses if you do not want to lose them for good.

‘Traders now face an uncertain future, with the closure of the markets compounded by the cancellation of the proposed new site at Dagenham. It is vital that the Mayor plays his part to rescue these markets and protect the value their businesses bring to London.’

A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: ‘Small businesses are the backbone of London’s economy. The Mayor believes wholesale markets are important to London and is clear that any decisions made about the future of these sites need to be agreed by the traders.’

Following the Corporation’s decision last month, Deputy Hayward said the move ’empowers traders to build a sustainable future in premises that align with their long-term business goals’.

‘By stepping back from direct market operations, we will help to create opportunities for these businesses to thrive independently,’ he said. ‘We’ve worked closely with the traders and thank them for their input and understanding. We’re committed to making sure they have the financial support and guidance they need to transition seamlessly and successfully to new locations.’
