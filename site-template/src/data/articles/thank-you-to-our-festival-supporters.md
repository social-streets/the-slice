There are many amazing things about organising a local event such as Roman Road Festival but one of the main ones is meeting the rock stars of our community: the residents who offer their precious spare time, the local businesses who go above and beyond what is required of them and the local community groups whose enthusiasm has no bounds; all sharing our passion to improve the area in which we live, shop, work and play. Without these wonderful people we couldn’t have delivered our third community festival, Roman Road Summer Festival 2015, so here is a big thank-you from us.

## **Impact**

A high street community event like Roman Road Festival is a great opportunity to bring a bit of village life to urban living. It's a friendly way to meet your neighbours and get to know local shops and businesses a bit better. However, we also wanted to share the other ways it is helping to improve our local high street, both in the short term and long term.

### **Improving public realm**

Each time we produce Roman Road Festival we try out different concepts and ideas to test their viability and demonstrate the possibilities of Roman Road. Last summer we trialled a cross-shaped festival space near Parnell Road and back-to-back stalls in Roman Road market in December. This year was even more demanding as we trialled two different areas of public realm on two different festival days: Gladstone Place and Roman Road car park.

Gladstone Place is the closest thing Roman Road E3 has to a ‘town square’ so we wanted to see if this oddly-shaped, uneven ribbon of land with its municipal lighting, seating and street fixtures, could ever be our ‘village green’, an area for local residents to gather and celebrate local life.  The ‘Village Screen’ returned ([SEE PICTURES](https://romanroadlondon.com/festival-village-screen-sports-day-pictures)) with a bigger outdoor screen, more bunting, more artificial grass and the new addition of straw bales. With food and drink stalls around the perimeter and sports and children’s entertainment zones making the best use of dead-end alcoves, the space felt welcoming and homely and the day attracted nearly 4,000 people without ever feeling crowded.

The second public place we tested was the carpark on the corner of Roman Road and St Stephen’s Road on which we hosted a Sunday market and Eid party ([SEE PICTURES](https://romanroadlondon.com/festival-eid-party-sunday-market-pictures)) to celebrate the end of Ramadan. This car park is at a critical junction on Roman Road: it’s at the heart of our high street neighbourhood and is a vital connecting point between Roman Road and the entrance to Roman Road Market, benefiting from high visibility and footfall. There were many logistical problems about using the car park, but on the day the space exceeded all expectations. It brought this usually dead space to colourful and vibrant life, housed a Sunday market and Eid party with plenty of space for the circa 3,000 people who visited, including a lot of passing trade who came in because they saw what was going on.

Feedback from each public realm trial will be submitted as formal recommendations to the local authority for public realm improvements and also for funding bids to deliver these improvements.

### **Supporting local economy**

Unlike many festivals, enormous effort is put in to making sure the event is ‘made from 90% local ingredients’. Rather than use national agencies to source entertainment, food stalls, crew and management services, we turn to the local community wherever possible: local design, print and distribution services to print and send flyers and posters; local grocery stores, hardware shops and photocopying services to purchase festival materials and supplies; local designer-makers, artists and new businesses for the Sunday market, including many first-time stall holders; local artists, singers, dancers, school choirs and drama groups to stage productions; local food and drink suppliers for the street food and drink stalls, and local community groups to help deliver elements of the event. Keeping it local means local businesses are the ones that benefit.

### **Showcasing local shops/reducing empty shops**

To ensure local shops gain from the publicity and footfall of the event, we encourage local businesses to host special events, workshops and discounts during the festival week. This year 14 local businesses hosted festival events. All 'fringe events' are listed in a dedicated section of the printed festival programme as well as online. Over 30,000 printed festival programmes are distributed in the shops along Roman Road; in community hubs in Bow; to every child in six local primary schools, and hand-to-hand outside local tube stations. Each event was posted on our social media channels. The festival attracted over 6,000 visitors to Roman Road during both days offering a unique opportunity for local businesses to benefit from the publicity and to convert the increased footfall into new visitors.

By raising the profile of the road and by demonstrating the vibrancy of the area, the event is also a way to attract new businesses and traders to the road and market. The long term benefit of this will be the reduction of the number of empty shops on Roman Road, which is above the national average and the highest in Tower Hamlets.

### **Encouraging community cohesion**

To be as inclusive and accessible as possible the event is free. There is no ticket entry and the entertainment costs such as the face painters, henna tattooist, craft workshops, guided history tours are free, funded by the festival so that it costs residents nothing. Additionally, this year the festival teamed up with Summer Night Lights to give away tokens for free food, which went down a treat of course.

The festival is the single annual community event in Bow that brings together together local residents, businesses, artists and community groups on one day, in one place, all united in celebrating local life. The event provides a fertile ground for new introductions, connections and collaborations within the community. Feedback from the events shows that the 'community atmosphere' is one of the main attractions of the event.

## **Supporters & Sponsors**

To organise this feat of logistics and community coordination requires a huge amount of energy and support. To keep this going we need as much as help as possible, not just in donations and volunteer-power but also in expressions of interest. _If you want to see this work continue and improve, please add your expressions of support and any feedback for improvements in the comments section at the bottom of this article_.
