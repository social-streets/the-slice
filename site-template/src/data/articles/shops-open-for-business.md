It is lockdown round 3.0 Roman Roadies! Although many services deemed essential, such as supermarkets and pharmacies, are largely operating as normal (with delivery services for those who want to minimise social contact), you may have noticed many of our high street cafes, restaurants and service shops have changed.

Most cafes and restaurants remain open but have switched to delivery, collection and takeaway options as sitting in is no longer allowed. Instead, many have niftily transformed the entrances of their establishments into takeaway hubs.

We've stated if the business are open for collection, delivering or operating as usual. So if you cannot leave your home or want to minimise your outings, you can use these services to order meals, grocery items, or even medicine. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list - is there a business that we should include?
