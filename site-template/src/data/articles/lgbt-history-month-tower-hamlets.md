From movie screenings and art exhibitions to drag nights and community gardening, Tower Hamlets is celebrating LGBT History Month in full force. 

[LGBT History Month](https://lgbtplushistorymonth.co.uk/) is the time of the year when museums, libraries, art galleries and charities come together to celebrate the life and work of queer people from all over the world.

In the UK, LGBT History Month has three taglines: ‘Claiming our past. Celebrating our present. Creating our future.’ For centuries, queer people have been forced to hide in the shadows, repressing the truth of their identity in the face of violent prejudice.

The month of February brings an opportunity to rewrite the narrative and shine a spotlight on the monumental achievements of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from the past and the present.

The first LGBT History Month in the UK took place in February 2005, and was founded by Sue Sanders and Paul Patrick, then co-chairs of Schools OUT UK, the LGBT education charity. The month coincided with the anniversary of the abolition of Section 28 in February 2003, which finally dismantled a series of discriminatory laws across Britain that prohibited the ‘promotion of homosexuality’ by local authorities.

Each year, Schools Out UK picks a new theme for February, and this year it’s ‘Medicine - #UnderTheScope’. Throughout history, queer people have made immense contributions to public health, from Sophia Jex-Blake, the founder of the London School of Medicine for Women in 1874, to Cherry Valentine, the drag queen and mental health nurse from RuPaul’s Drag Race UK.

If you want to uncover [the local queer history of Tower Hamlets](https://romanroadlondon.com/the-backstreet-gay-leather-fetish-club-mile-end/), here is a list of top picks of exhibitions, open mic nights and archive events in celebration of LGBT History Month 2024.

Sunday 28 January - Sunday 25 February 

Badge Cafe, founded by Ben Walters, is a ‘crafty utopian hangout’ - a queer community premised on the radical joy of badgemaking. In Archiving Desires, his new exhibition at Rich Mix, Walters showcases the badges he made through cutout vintage magazines and the ‘found’ collages crafted by Badge Cafe participants. Discover how queer people sought connection in pre-digital times, and how queer people today engage with material from the past. The exhibition is free entry and badgemaking hangouts are Pay What You Can.
