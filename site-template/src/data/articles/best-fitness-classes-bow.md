They may be tucked away in unexpected places, but Roman Road offers a range and quality of fitness classes that would rival Third Place or Barry's Bootcamp.

With your recommendations, we've rounded up reader's favourites from outdoor boxing classes in Vicky Park, to bouldering in Mile End. Weird, wacky and wonderful, Roman Road seems to have it all.

So, a little less conversation and a little more action, or climbing, jumping, stretching, squatting or dancing.

## 9Rounds, Roman Road

![Trio on rounds in 9Round Bow, Roman Road, Bow, East London.](/images/9Round-roman-road-boxing-club-kick-front-1024x683.jpg)

[9Round](https://www.9round.co.uk/), the kickboxing fitness club with studios around the world, has a branch on Roman Road. The studio offers Bow locals a high-intensity workout that fits in with busy lifestyles through the short 30-minute length and circuit style with no class times.

Originally an American venture, 9Round has made waves in New Zealand, Japan, and the Middle East, and is growing fast in the UK too. By throwing its hat into Bow’s ring, 9Round brings its flexible brand of fitness to the East End. The club offers locals the chance to box and kick for exercise, self-improvement, and fun, rather than competition.

## Mile End Climbing Wall

![Mile End Climbing wall](/images/mile-end-climbing-wall.jpg)

This climbing wall has been around since the 80s and has long been one of London's top climbing spots. As a registered charity, by paying to climb at the wall, customers help offer opportunities to youth groups, vulnerable young people and groups with special educational needs.

The wall is open to all abilities and offers bouldering walls (low level climbing without ropes), as well as top-roped and lead climbing.

## Hackney Wick Bouldering

Just over the footbridge into Hackney Wick is this new clambering kid on the climbing block. Book a [taster session](https://romanroadlondon.com/fathers-day-things-to-do-east-london/), and after an hour with an instructor, you will know enough to go by yourself. And if you’re new to climbing, or just don't want to climb alone, they also run Boulder Socials, informal, friendly drop-in sessions where you can meet new people.

## Bee Fit Pilates

Teacher Bee Hurst aims to help people who sit at a desk all day, who have aches and pains, or who just want to strengthen their cores. Pilates is the perfect way to get strong and fit without adding bulk, no matter how tall, small, young or old you are.

Bunsen started practising pilates in 2003 after suffering from a back injury, and loved it so much she left her career as an executive producer on TV to become a teacher. Her classes are dynamic and incorporate barre moves. They are aimed at all levels and abilities.

## Stratford Padel Club

![](/images/Padel-Club-1024x683.jpg)

Padel has taken the UK by storm over the last few years. We feel very lucky to have the UK’s largest club on our doorstep in Stratford, which includes an outdoor court. A cross between squash and tennis, the game is now bigger than football in Spain, and it seems as though every tennis club in the UK is now building a padel court. It’s always doubles, and always followed by a beer at the bar. So get your trainers on and jump on a court.
