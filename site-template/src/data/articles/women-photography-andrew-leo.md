In celebration of International Women's Day we're tipping our hats to the women of Roman Road. Andrew Leo's documentary photography captures a feel for E2 and E3's real women. For more from Leo, check out our galleries at [Colourful Characters of Roman Road](https://romanroadlondon.com/colourful-characters-roman-road-photography-andrew-leo/) and [Life, Laughter and Liquor on Roman Road](https://romanroadlondon.com/life-laughter-liquor-roman-road-photography-andrew-leo/).
