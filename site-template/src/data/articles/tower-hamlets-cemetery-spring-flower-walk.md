Tower Hamlets Cemetery is surely one of the most idyllic spots in our area. Tucked away behind Mile End tube station, you’ll find a secret realm of nature and, at this time of year, it is resplendent in its spring colours.

This photo essay documents the tapestry of new petals in the cemetery, emerging from their winter’s slumber. There’s a spiritual feel to the blossoming flowers mingling with the tumbling tombstones - death and rebirth entwined. 

The appearance of these fresh yellow, blue and white buds signals not only the end of the chilly season, but a sign of new hope. 

[Tower Hamlets cemetery](//romanroadlondon.com/foraging-tower-hamlets-cemetery-park-bow/) is just big enough for visitors to get lost among the foliage, dusted with pretty hawthorn blossom rather than snow at this time of year. 

It’s a great place for dog walkers as dogs love the adventure of exploring its winding paths. However, those with pets in tow beware. If consumed, daffodils can have rather adverse effects on the stomachs of our furry friends. 

It’s always a wonder that this place of peace and quiet resides so close to the bustling traffic and commuters of [Bow Road](https://romanroadlondon.com/bow-road-railway-station-history/) and [Mile End tube station](https://romanroadlondon.com/mile-end-tube-luke-agbaimoni-photographs/). Although [Vicky Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/aerial-photography-victoria-park-matt-payne/) might usually be your walk of choice, we recommend a visit to the cemetery while the spring flowers are at their finest.
