UK bubble tea franchise, Mooboo, opens its doors on Roman Road Market offering its customers over 1,000 combinations of its sweet-flavoured teas.

Fancy a cuppa? No, not a brew with a splash of milk but a crème brûlée or chocolate mint tea? Welcome to the quirky world of bubble tea.

Roman Road welcomed Mooboo, a UK bubble tea franchise, to the neighbourhood earlier this month.

Bubble tea is a drink that usually consists of tea infused with fruit juices or milk, accompanied by chewy tapioca balls.

Opening on 20 February, Mooboo is the second bubble tea café to call Roman Road home: Bubblin Café, a few shops further down the road, opened its doors last summer. A third bubble tea café, Bubbleupp, will open in the coming days.

The quick succession of bubble tea stores trading in the area points to a wider UK craze for the sweet and colourful drink. The [first bubble tea shop in the UK opened over ten years ago in London](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28640188#:~:text=Assad%20Khan%2C%20a%20former%20investment%20banker%2C%20opened%20the%20UK%27s%20first%20bubble%20tea%20shop%20in%20Soho%2C%20London%2C%20in%202011.). Now, there are around 250 bubble tea shops across the UK, of which just over 55 are owned by the Mooboo franchise.

Roman Road Mooboo’s owner Saqib Riaz said that while he was concerned about the store’s opening weekend because of Storm Eunice, the café ‘had the best turnout that anyone could ever hope for. People still queued up for us.’ 

Riaz added that on their first day of trading Mooboo sold over 500 cups of the sweetened drink.

The top sellers so far have been fruit teas, crème brûlée tea, and brown sugar tea. Alongside these popular choices, Mooboo offers more than 1,000 bubble tea combinations, adding that ‘the sky is the limit’, according to its website. 

All of Mooboo's drinks come with the signature ‘bubbles’ and fans of the drink can also choose from milk tea, which can be served either hot or cold.

Mooboo offers all students a discount. As for future deals, Mooboo will have a deal for Mother's Day on 27 March and will hold further deals for International Milk Tea Week, starting 23 April and ending 30 April, which also coincides with [Bubble Tea Day](https://nationaltoday.com/national-bubble-tea-day/).
