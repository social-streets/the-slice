_UppublicationDate: 02/10/2020: The public inquiry into turning the Whitechapel Bell Foundry into a boutique hotel takes place on 6 Tuesday October. You can have your say by emailing **Development.Control@TowerHamlets.gov.uk**  for more information on how you can attend the inquiry meeting._

Raycliff Capital has submitted plans to Tower Hamlets Council for the Whitechapel Bell Foundry to be changed from a foundry to a hotel.

Most of the foundry site has Grade II\* listed status. Raycliff have proposed replacing a non-listed 1980s building at the rear of the site with a 108 room hotel.

The application has sparked fresh protest from the Save the Whitechapel Bell Foundry campaign, which believes the heritage of the building should be preserved.

The Gentle Author of Spitalfields Life, a leading voice in the campaign to save the foundry, has been unconvinced by the developer's 'heritage-led design.'

The Gentle Author said: 'The reality is they are reducing the foundry use by more than 90%. In spite of this attempt to muddy the waters, I think the difference between a boutique hotel and a bell foundry is quite obvious.'

The alternative proposed by protesters is that the United Kingdom Historic Building Preservation Trust and Factum Foundation buy the buildings and re-open them as a foundry for bell production and art casting.

Whitechapel Bell Foundry closed in June 2017 after nearly 450 of bell making. Its most famous bells include Big Ben, Bow Bells, and the Liberty Bell.

The East End Preservation Society delivered a Change.org petition with 10,000 signatures to Downing Street in 2017, which objected to the repurposing of the foundry.

Whether you support or oppose the proposals, it is important that you make your voice heard to those in a position to affect them.
