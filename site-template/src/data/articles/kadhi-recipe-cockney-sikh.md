To celebrate the publication of a book _Modest Living Memoirs of a Cockney Sikh_ we are sharing one of the Punjabi recipes from the book cooked by Suresh Singh's wife - a wholesome Kadhi.

The book _Memoirs of a Cockney Sigh_ published by Spitalfields Life Books tells a story of Suresh and his family who have lived in their house in Princelet St for 70 years. It is the first London Sikh biography to be published in the UK and comprises of stories, photographs and experiences of growing up Punjabi in London. In the book, chapters of biography are alternated with a series of Sikh recipes by Jagir Kaur, Suresh’s wife.

Kadhi consists of a thick gravy based on chickpea flour, and contains vegetable fritters called pakoras, to which dahi (yogurt) is added to give it a bit of sour taste. It is often eaten with boiled rice or roti (round flatbread). The yoghurt fills you up while the turmeric gives it a beautiful yellow colour. The lovely thing about this yogurt curry is that you can add as many vegetables as you please to it.

Makes about twenty generous portions.

#### Ingredients

_For the base_

400g full fat yogurt 3–3.5 litres of hot water 1 cup besan flour (gram/chickpea flour) 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder 75g butter

_For the caramelised onion mixture_

butter/ghee or mustard oil 1 large onion, finely chopped 1 tomato, diced 1 can of tomatoes 1 whole bulb of garlic, finely chopped 7 green chillies, finely chopped 1 teaspoon of salt 1 pinch Hing-Asafoetida 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds 3 inch piece of ginger, finely chopped 5 curry leaves, rinse them under water if you use dried ones 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder

#### Method

First make the base. In a large bowl, mix the yogurt, turmeric, besan flour and butter. Gradually add the water – do this slowly and mix well to make sure there are no lumps.

Pour this mixture into a large pot on a medium heat and bring to a boil. You need to stir the mixture all the time. If you do not stir the mixture continuously, it will become lumpy and stick to the bottom of the pot. Once the mixture has come to the boil, reduce the heat. The base mixture must simmer for about two hours, and you need keep stirring it regularly.

To make the caramelised onion mixture, cook all the ingredients in the butter/ghee or mustard oil until golden brown.

Once the base mixture has been simmering for about two hours, add the caramelised onion mixture and simmer, stirring occasionally, for another fifteen minutes.

For added flavour, you can sprinkle some Garam Masala on top. Jagir uses a teaspoon each of jeera (cumin), coriander seeds, cardamom seeds, green cardamon, sunth (dried ginger powder), and two whole cloves of garlic, one cinnamon stick and three black peppercorns. She mixes and grinds this all together.
