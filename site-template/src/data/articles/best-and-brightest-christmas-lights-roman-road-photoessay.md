One of our favourite things about Roman Road is how everyone - cafes, shops and houses alike - gets into the Christmas spirit.

You may have spotted the window illustrations on Cafe East, adding a festive cheer to the perma-queue outside.

Or perhaps you have been admiring the neon stars, presents, and Christmas ornaments festooning the length of Roman Road?

Even residents are getting into the spirit: every year we are impressed with the many beautifully decked out houses we spotted out and about, and this year seems to be a bumper crop.

There were all manner of light displays: from tiny fairy lights delicately glittering on roof-tops, to maximalist, colourful displays that you can't help but stop and admire.

So we sent our local photographer [Phil Verney](https://romanroadlondon.com/?s=phil+verney) (who also happens to be a whizz at [night photography](https://romanroadlondon.com/e3-night-sky-phil-verney/)), on a hunt to find the best and brightest Christmas light decorations around Roman Road.
