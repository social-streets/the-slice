Borough-wide dog control order agreed to be reduced by the council after a successful petition.  

A petition from the Animal Welfare Party and East London Dog Community against the proposed Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) received unanimous support in the full Council meeting held on 20 November. 

The motion was agreed to reject or significantly reduce the proposed PSPO which if passed would restrict where and how owners can walk their dogs in the borough. 

A petition was presented by the two organisations, highlighting concerns over the potential negative consequences for dogs, people and the wider community. 

The Animal Welfare Party and East London Dog Community recommended considering alternative actions from the petition and continuing discussions with local dog groups to balance the interests of responsible dog owners and other park users, ensuring they aren't penalised by a PSPO decision.

If passed the plans would introduce a borough-wide Dog Control Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO). 

The PSPO is aimed at promoting safe interactions between people and dogs in shared public spaces. 

Proposals include requiring dogs to be kept on a lead in all parks, including Victoria Park and open spaces, restricting dogs from un-gated children’s play areas and sports zones, and limiting dog walkers to four dogs at a time.

Jane Smith, Deputy Leader of Animal Welfare Party said: ‘The most restrictive of these plans have the potential to severely impact dog welfare by limiting access to off-lead exercise, play and species-specific behaviour for the thousands of dogs living in the borough.

‘At the same time, the overall perception of dogs could be negatively impacted and community relations strained.’

In response to the proposed PSPO, the recently formed East London Dog Community expressed support for three out of the five measures being considered.

They back restrictions on dog fouling, the requirement for dogs to be kept on a lead when directed by an official, and the exclusion of dogs from certain gated areas, such as children’s play parks.

However, they argue that the remaining proposals are ineffective, disproportionately impactful, and likely to create more problems than they solve. 

They highlight that the issues these measures aim to address will be displaced to other areas, rather than resolved.

Bernadette Moriarty, spokesperson for East London Dog Community said: ‘For many, including elderly and disabled people, dog walks aren’t just exercise: they’re a lifeline. 

‘We want to find a solution that supports the many benefits of dog ownership while resolving dog-related anti-social behaviour by targeting the source of the problems: a small number of irresponsible owners.’ 

We contacted Tower Hamlets Council for a statement on the next steps regarding the PSPO and are awaiting a response.
