The American-inspired bakery is reopening its only East London outpost next to Spitalfields Market after a makeover.

Following a makeover and freshly marble-clad, the Hummingbird Bakery is reopening its Spitalfields branch’s pink doors on Thursday 8 June 2023 to satisfy the East End’s Red Velvet cravings. 

The largest of the franchise’s five bakeries, the Spitalfields branch (and Head Bakery) is found around the corner from Spitalfields Market at 11 Frying Pan Alley, E1. 

Also the flagship bakery, the Spitalfields branch is the last store to receive a revamping in line with the Hummingbird Bakery’s new style and franchise-wide refresh. This includes a customisation station, an open-plan kitchen where you can observe the bakers at work, and a reinstated outdoor seating area to soak up some rays while satisfying your sweet tooth. Of course, fresh licks of the signature Hummingbird pink paint also feature throughout.

Founded in 2004, The Hummingbird Bakery is known for bringing American-style baking to the UK, finding its place as the London home for cupcakes, cheesecakes, pies, layer cakes and brownies. But it is perhaps the Hummingbird Bakery’s role in the meteoric rise of Red Velvet cake's popularity for which it is best known – a staple of the ‘classic range’ that remains in place alongside rotating monthly specials, including gluten-free and vegan options.

The Spitalfields branch will also offer products exclusive to the flagship bakery, like Eton Mess Red Velvet Ice Cream and Ice Cream Cupcakes.

If you’re looking to add some Instagrammable flair to your day, those living close to the flagship bakery can also enjoy the special delivery service. Your baked goods will be hand-delivered by Ricardo, the cake concierge, dressed in a Wes Anderson-esque head-to-toe pink velvet suit.  

_The Hummingbird Bakery Spitalfields will be open Monday to Sunday, 09:00-18:00 at 11 Frying Pan Alley, London E1 7HS._
