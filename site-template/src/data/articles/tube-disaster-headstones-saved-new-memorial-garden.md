Relatives rejoice as those who died in the Bethnal Green Disaster are now remembered both where they died and where they were laid to rest.

Bethnal Green Tube disaster headstones have been reinstalled in their new home in Manor Park Cemetery following a four-year campaign by local activists. 

Ben Priestley, 61, has lived in Bow since 1994 and has always been interested in the history of Tower Hamlets, especially during WWII. 

Priestley brought together a community campaign to memorialise the victims of the Bethnal Green Tube disaster, an effort driven by his passion for preserving civilian war history. 

The disaster occurred on March 3, 1943, when [overcrowding at the underground shelter led to a chaotic crush](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/tube-disaster-history/), killing 173 people. Most were buried across local cemeteries, including Manor Park Cemetery. 

Priestley began his efforts in 2020 after learning that the 22 victims' headstones were at risk of being cleared. Manor Park Cemetery, agreed to the project, sharing plans for the memorial in January 2024.

The commemorative garden, which preserves the original headstones, was officially opened in May 2024, marking the end of a four-year campaign.

‘It was important to me to keep the historical records alive and after spending time with the victims' relatives they helped me to understand how strongly they felt about their fears and concerns,’ explained Priestley. 

The Stairway to Heaven Trust, led by Sandra Scotting, worked alongside Priestley, as did several relatives of the victims. 

Scotting said: ‘When we first reached out to the relatives of the victims they were so upset and horrified to find out the headstones might be removed but I could share the good news of the new memorial being finalised I know they felt so much happier and comforted that there is something representing their relatives.’

For Scotting, whose mother, aunt, and other relatives were victims of the disaster, it was important that people could feel a connection in two key locations: the Stairway to Heaven memorial at the site of the tragedy, and the cemeteries where the victims were buried. This way, their memory is honoured both where they died and where they rest.

The 22 victims who were buried in Manor Park and whose headstones are now a part of the new memorial garden: 

Annie Louisa Boxer, Elizabeth Matilda Bendon, Mary Hall, Irene Hall, Bessie Bowling, Jean Mary Maguire, Ethel Beaken, Jessie Louisa Asser, Rose Maud Leggett, Benjamin George Leggett, Roy Benjamin Leggett, Ronald Roy Lapham, Caroline Ivy Johnson, Ellen Emma Johnson, Annie Eva Ellam, Francis Lilian Ellam, Rosian Ellen Ellam, Louisa Ellen Loftus, John Samuel Loftus, Elsie Hilda Woolnough, Olive Elsie Woolnough, Annie Jessie Hall, Edna Phoebe Hall, Elizabeth Brooks, Henry Norman Brooks, Rosina Papworth, Stella Annie Violet Riddell, Dorothy Ann Smith, Clara Emery. 

The legacy of the Bethnal Green Tube Disaster continues, notably through Millie Bobby Brown’s book _Nineteen Steps_, which is reportedly being adapted into a Netflix film. However, there has been confusion recently, with some mistakenly linking the disaster to Steve McQueen’s new film _Blitz_. 

Priestley said: ‘ I think it’s great that the victims are now getting the recognition they deserve and recent generations can now connect to the story and learn about their local history.’ 

The campaign is pleased with its success, as the victims are now receiving greater recognition and are being honoured as individuals. The strong sense of community throughout the effort has also helped bring more attention to the disaster and its lasting impact.

A memorial service is currently being organised by the charity and will be held at the new memorial garden at Manor Park Cemetery in November. A date is yet to be confirmed.
