#### In the last instalment of **Tamsin Robinson**’s lockdown desserts, our resident Cordon-bleu pastry chef shares her recipe of almond and coconut tray bake. All the ingredients can be found in local food stores.

‘This tray bake is incidentally gluten-free, and is perfect as a teatime snack or to serve as a pudding with a dollop of coconut yoghurt drizzled with honey,’ says Robinson, who has developed this almond and coconut recipe especially for Roman Road LDN.

#### Ingredients

_For an eight square bake, cut into nine generous portions_

- 120g unsalted butter, melted
- 80g runny honey
- 50g caster sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 165g ground almonds
- 100g desiccated coconut
- 2 tsp baking powder
- Pinch of salt
- A handful of flaked almonds

#### Method

First of all, preheat your oven to 170°C fan.

Grease and line an eight inch square baking tin then set aside until needed later.

In a large bowl, whisk together the honey, sugar and eggs until they become thickened and frothy. (Best to use an electric whisk if you have one!)  

Mix in the melted butter.

Add in the ground almonds, coconut, baking powder and salt, then mix until just combined.

Pour the batter into the prepared tin, then scatter over the flaked almonds.

Bake for 30-35 mins. Test to see it’s ready by inserting a skewer or knife into the middle of the cake. If it comes out clean, it’s done. If not, bake for a few more minutes and test again. 

Leave to cool in the tin for five mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool.
