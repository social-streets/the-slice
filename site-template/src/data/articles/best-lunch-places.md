With new cafes and lunch spots popping up in Bow, we thought that a roundup of the best places for lunch on Roman Road might come in handy.

Luckily for us, we live in a multicultural area so there is no need to get tired of the same old thing. With Carribean, Turkish, British, Cockney, Moroccan, and Italian options, we can travel the world without leaving the Roman. Looking for something healthy? Check. Craving something filling? Check. Want a cosy hub to escape your makeshift office? Check. Need to grab-and-go? … you get the drift. We’ve got all bases covered. Enjoy!
