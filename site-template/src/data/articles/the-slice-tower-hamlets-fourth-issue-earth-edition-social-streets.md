The Slice Tower Hamlet's fourth issue is a special earth edition and reports on initiatives that are tackling climate change during a cost-of-living crisis. 

The special Earth edition of _The Slice_ magazine is now available at stockists across Tower Hamlets, in time for International Earth Day on Saturday 22 April. 

Published by Social Streets C.I.C., the not-for-profit digital media company that publishes Roman Road LDN, this edition of _The Slice_ features sustainable organisations and initiatives across Tower Hamlets showing that the climate emergency and the cost-of-living crisis can be fought side-by-side. 

The print magazine is the same brand of community-centred news and culture that is published online at Roman Road LDN, showcasing content from all four of Social Streets’ platforms in Tower Hamlets: [Roman Road LDN](https://romanroadlondon.com/), [Bethnal Green LDN](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/), [Whitechapel LDN](https://whitechapellondon.co.uk/) and [Poplar LDN](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/).

As a social enterprise, Social Streets uses journalism to strengthen the community by exploring ideas around home and identity and helping people connect with each other.

Social Streets’ founder Tabitha Stapely said: ‘The Slice is more thoughtful, more inspiring and more community-led than most local publications. 

‘Compared to more conventional local newspapers that have a more sensationalist and often inflammatory approach to news, we focus on constructive journalism that shows both sides of the argument and tries to find solutions to local issues.’

Against the backdrop of soaring prices and the climate emergency, this issue of _The Slice_ explores how our borough is becoming a model for grassroots environmental change for the many, not the few. 

From [Stitches in Time](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/stitches-in-time-fabricworks-limehouse-town-hall-isolation-sustainable-fashion/) arts and education charity in Limehouse, to Hackney Wick’s [first zero-waste restaurant](https://romanroadlondon.com/silo-zero-waste-hackney-wick-restaurant-review/) and the [Blueprint Architects](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/blueprint-architects-tackling-food-security-tower-hamlets/) redesigning how food is produced across the borough, the articles shine a light on the local organisations and initiatives leading the way in sustainable living. 

With 10,000 copies of _The Slice_ available, you can pick up a magazine at any of the Idea Stores in Tower Hamlets as well as community centres such as Stepney City Farm, Toynbee Hall, Poplar Union and [Bow Church](https://romanroadlondon.com/bow-church-history-blitzed-east-end-bow-road/). 

Most of the cafes, pubs and shops along the Roman will also be stocked up with the mag, so next time you’re doing your shopping at the market make sure to pick up a copy.
