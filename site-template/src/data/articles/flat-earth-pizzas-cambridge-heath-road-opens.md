A pop-up restaurant, awarded the most sustainable food business in 2021, is set to open its first permanent establishment on Cambridge Heath Road.

Sarah Brading and Rich Baker brought Flat Earth Pizzas to fruition as a pop-up two years ago. Their aim was to create a business model that could lead by example and become a blueprint for change. Now they are to launch their new restaurant on 12 April, returning to the site of their very first pop-up in Bethnal Green.

Sarah and Rich believe in a ‘root-to-shoot’ philosophy. This means they try to use every part of the produce possible, in order to reduce waste and become more sustainable. Any food that can’t be preserved gets picked up and taken to become fertiliser for local farms. They have created a menu which concentrates on building a deeper connection with the ingredients and the people who produce them.

The couple focus on sourcing local, seasonal ingredients for their dishes, “It’s about always asking questions – how are ingredients produced, who is behind them, what’s the benefit to the planet in using them.” The focus on seasonality allows them to go more local where possible. For example, in the summer, they get plums from Tree Musketeers in Hackney and aubergines from Forty Hall Farm in Enfield.

The restaurant is located in an area buzzing with creativity and community. It’s situated on the corner of Cambridge Heath Road and Vyner Street. A cobbled lane that was historically a warehouse district, Vyner Street was home to a thriving art scene in the early 2000s. Nowadays it hosts a contemporary art gallery and Venetian style bar and restaurant, Ombra.

Pizzas will be served throughout the day at Flat Earth. There will also be additional seasonal small plates available in the evening. All dishes are either vegetarian or vegan. A menu full of flavour is cultivated through innovative uses of a range of natural produce. The restaurant has a capacity of 35 inside and 16 out.
