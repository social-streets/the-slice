A video made in [Victoria Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/) 12 months ago, which asks local runners intimate questions while they are running, has recently gone viral - again. If you missed it first time round, here it is.

Pounding the tarmac through the seasons, a band of runners in Tower Hamlet's Victoria Park are brazenly challenged with intimate questions as they pace their routes. Liberated from responsibilities, their guards drop dramatically, releasing funny and brutally frank confessions, and weaving a powerful narrative behind the anonymous masses.

Born from the idea that people might be more open if they were asked questions while running, Matan Rochlitz & Ivo Gormley’s documentary _The Runners_ provides an insightful glimpse into everyday life in East London by catching their subjects at a time when their inhibitions are at their most relaxed.

The video has received widespread acclaim and,  a year after it was first released, is attracting another flurry of attention. We love it too because it captures the diverse community that uses Victoria Park, affectionately known as The People's Park.

If you're wondering how they managed to film the runners so smoothly, the camera man interviewing the runners was seated on a plastic stool in a trailer pulled along behind a bicycle.

The Runners, a short film directed by Matan Rochlitz and Ivo Gormley and produced by Banyak Films, is supported by London Legacy Development Corporation and GoodGym. You can join a GoodGym, and get fit by doing good at [www.goodgym.org](https://www.goodgym.org/)
