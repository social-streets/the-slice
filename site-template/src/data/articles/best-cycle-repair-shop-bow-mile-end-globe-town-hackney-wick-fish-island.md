BEST FOR: NEW PLACE TO TRY

Roman Bikes recently opened on Roman Road, filling the void left by Paradise Cycles, which has moved to Bethnal Green. 

The small no-fuss shop offers repairs and sells a range of bikes and accessories. It’s right next to ‘Ello Bagels, another newcomer, and on the doorstep of the Ford Road bus stop. 

Roman Bikes is an open-plan combined salesroom and workshop, so you can watch your bike get fixed while you browse. Reviews so far say that the service is quick, well-priced and friendly. 

_You can find Roman Bikes at 437 Roman Road, London R3 5LX_

## Paradise Cycles

BEST FOR: FRIENDLY SERVICE

Having moved from Roman Road, [Paradise Cycles](https://romanroadlondon.com/paradise-cycles-james-johnson-louis-wigmore-interview/) is now located near Bethnal Green tube station. This cycle shop has a reputation as a friendly place whose helpful staff will fix your bike if you’re unlucky enough for something to go wrong. The staff will also help you understand what has gone wrong and how to better look after your bike. Their aim is to remain professional but less formal and intimidating than other bike shops

They also help people build bespoke bikes specifically for the type of cargo that they need to carry. For example, in 2021, they built a baker’s bike to carry fresh bread around South West London. Paradise Cycles created a modular stacking system of crates with an adjustable cover so that the bread could be saved from the rain.

[Bikeworks](https://romanroadlondon.com/inclusive-cycling-centre-olympic-park/) is a great place to visit if you’re just starting out cycling as they offer a selection of second-hand bikes that mechanics have verified as safe to ride. This will help you avoid getting a dodgy bike off eBay or Facebook Marketplace which could end up costing you more than you paid for it in repairs.

For anyone specifically interested in the mechanics of bikes, they also offer mechanic training programmes. 

The enterprise was created in 2006 by Zoe Portlock and Jim Blakemore and aims to get people cycling who otherwise would feel excluded due to reasons such as disability. They are invested in ensuring that recreational and commuter cycling is open to everyone. 

The classes that they offer help people who are nervous about cycling and offer a way for people to get together and make new friends.
