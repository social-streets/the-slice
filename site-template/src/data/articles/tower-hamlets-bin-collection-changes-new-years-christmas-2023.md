Tower Hamlets Council has published a detailed timetable of changes to bin collection services across the borough over the festive period and New Year’s Day.

It’s suddenly that time of the year again and the festive season has well and truly arrived.

But it wouldn’t be Christmas without a marathon of cooking and gift wrapping, which will undoubtedly make bins overflow and rubbish pile high.

With that being said, it’s important to know when the bins are being collected in your London borough, as there will be a slight change to services over the festive period.

For Tower Hamlets residents, the council has said on its website that all weekday collections will be a day later than usual. So if your rubbish is normally collected on a Monday, it will instead be collected on a Tuesday.

The council has published a detailed timetable on its website for changes to bin collections between Monday, December 25 and Saturday, January 7.

On Christmas Day, there will be no bin collection service across the entire borough. Instead, those who normally have their bins collected on Monday will see their bins collected the following day (Tuesday, December 26).

The same one-day delay will apply for Tuesday, December 26, Wednesday, December 27, Thursday, December 28 and Friday, December 29.

There will be a normal service on Saturday, December 30 and Sunday, December 31.

There will be no bin collections on New Year’s Day (Monday, January 1), with Monday’s collections being picked up the following day on Tuesday, January 2.

Bins will be collected one day later until Saturday, January 6 while residents can expect a normal service will return to the borough on Sunday, January 7.

Meanwhile, Christmas trees can be recycled between Monday, January 8 to Friday, January 19. For anyone who has a regular food and garden collection, the council has told residents that they can just take off the decorations and leave their tree outside on their scheduled day.

Christmas trees can also be recycled at the Reuse and Recycling Centre on Yabsley Street.
