**A list of the best hot chocolates in Bethnal Green’s array of cafes.**

As the winter months take hold, steaming soups, electric blankets and hot water bottles all begin to become features of our lives again. It is the time of year for the humble hot chocolate to tempt us out onto the frost-bitten streets. 

Londoners are kept on their toes with experimental hot chocolates, but your hot chocolate fix is available in many a cafe in Bethnal Green, and we have compiled a list of places you can get one. 

We have looked through Bethnal Green’s cafes, masters of the newly popular chai latte, the cortado and the ubiquitous flat white. As snow may begin to fall we might feel ourselves craving something a little more festive, and this is where the velvety richness of hot chocolate comes into its own. 

## **Astro Cafe** 

This Persian-run brunch spot is best for energising yourself amid winter blues, with its packed-out floor of weekend brunchers, and rightly so for its bargain Full English at such a central spot. 

However, it also offers an array of creatively flavoured doughnuts, such as Oreo and pistachio that you cold par with a hot chocolate to take away on a cold afternoon, on your way up to Columbia Road flower market. 

Despite the cue that congregates, their classic hot chocolate comes in at the cheaper end of Bethnal Green’s offering at £2.20 with regular milk, or oat, almond, soy and coconut for an extra 40p.
