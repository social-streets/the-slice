The Roman's diversity makes for charity shops with an exciting array of vintage clothing, classic books, and idiosyncratic homeware. We have the best pick of local stores for you to rummage through.

Decluttering our homes can be a chore, and in the rush to clear out, many of us end up throwing away treasures. For the vintage hunters and thrifters and among us, stumbling across these treasures is a dream. As the old saying goes, one man's trash is another man's treasure.

Our local charity shops are packed with gems just waiting to be unearthed.  

It’s a common misconception that sustainable fashion has a big price tag. With so many wonderful charity shops around Roman Road, there is no excuse to contribute to the world’s second-largest polluter by buying fast fashion. 

Below is a list of our favourite local spots, which sell everything from clothes and shoes to books and vinyl, so you can get your retail therapy responsibly.

## Ayoka

BEST FOR: JOYFUL BARGAINS

Ayoka is a Nigerian name that means “one who causes joy”, and joy is exactly what you will feel after visiting St Margaret's House’s charity shop. Despite not being directly on the high street, Ayoka is sure to catch your eye on Old Ford Road due to its visually striking and regularly updated window displays. St Margaret’s House is dedicated to creating positive social change and opportunities for the local community, so every penny spent on clothes, shoes, accessories, homeware or vinyl in Ayoka is giving back to East London. 

With enough donations to fill a yoga studio, store manager Nigel and his team are keen to usher customers in to browse their bespoke wares. At Ayoka, you are guaranteed to find a bargain on the rails, and if you are lucky, Nigel will even pop the kettle on for a warm cuppa.

_Find Ayoka at 23 Old Ford Road, E2 9PJ_

Found on one of the prettiest streets in Bethnal Green, it may shock first-time visitors that Jambala is a second-hand bookstore; such is the pristine condition of its shopfront and wares. You will regularly find a new release in their window, proving the generosity of Jambala’s donors, which even extends to rare books. Jambala is the perfect spot for gift shopping, boasting a fine collection of plant-based candles and essential oils. 

Owned by the nearby London Buddhist Centre, shopping at Jambala means contributing to their dedicated work and helping to spread the peaceful teachings of the Buddha to the local community through a variety of well-being events and activities.

L_ama’s Pyjamas has been serving the Roman Road community since 2010; it’s the place to go for everything from designer clothes at affordable prices to household basics to kit out a new home. Some particularly devoted customers visit the shop nearly every day – the best way to find the best bargains – and you definitely get the sense of Lama’s as a community hub, with staff and customers enjoying catching up with each other while checking out the latest donations._

_Like Jambala, Lama’s is part of the London Buddhist Centre. The money raised enables the Centre to offer meditation classes on a donation basis rather than charging a fee, meaning people can attend regardless of income (so why not drop in and try out a class after you’ve done your shop_ping?_)_

## Oxfam Victoria Park

BEST FOR: THRIFTY GEMS

Oxfam, in Victoria Park Village, urges customers to ‘set the trend with secondhand’. They make it easy to do so with their impressive collection of clothes, books, artwork, and kids' toys. For such a small space, shop managers Kris and Berta work hard to fit in many gems. Their friendly banter warms the shop on even the coldest of days. 

The impressive global work of Oxfam goes without saying, so you can shop here knowing a few quid here and there will contribute to alleviating poverty. Spots like this are why East London is known for its charity and second-hand shops. People travel from all over for the thrill of finding remarkable individual pieces at a low cost. Art lovers should also make sure to keep their eyes on this store as it is no stranger to a high-valued painting while sticking to Oxfam’s fair price policy.

## Spitalfields Crypt Trust

BEST FOR: FASHION THAT CARES

The work of Spitalfields Crypt Trust towards supporting people recovering from addiction and homelessness is crucial to our local community and undoubtedly transforms lives. Shopping at one of their eight charity shops, such as the one on Roman Road high street, will bag yourself a fashion bargain while contributing to an organisation that truly cares. 

The Roman Road shop's carefully curated displays provide an intriguing shopping experience. The trust has even gone online by creating a Depop store, @sctdepop so that you can shop second-hand from the comfort of your bedroom.

## Bohemia

BEST FOR: ESOTERIC ANTIQUES

Greek statue heads, a golden birdcage, classic books and vintage shirts. Bohemia’s unpredictable array of items typifies any good, local second-hand shop. Sat on the Roman just a short hop from the [Ecology Pavilion in Mile End Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/eco-pavilion-mile-end-park-history/), Bohemia’s intimate space generates a welcoming and homely atmosphere.

Stumble in after a walk down Roman Road’s bustling market for a carefree gander.
