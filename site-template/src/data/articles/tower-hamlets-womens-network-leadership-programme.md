Account3 believes all women deserve economic independence, and their leadership programme provides minority ethnic women in Tower Hamlets with the skills to make this possible.

Tower Hamlets Women's Network (THWN), facilitated by Account3, will re-launch its ‘Dare to Lead’ leadership programme in February, aimed to empower [ethnically diverse](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/praxis-giants-cook-book-migrants-recipes/) women to be leaders in their chosen fields.  

Founded in 1991 in [Bethnal Green](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/dangerous-junction-hackney-road-cambridge-heath/), Account3 hosts community training and development cooperatives, including THWN’s Dare to Lead programme, funded by the Tower Hamlets Mayors' Grant.

The new leadership programme, starting in February, will seek to elevate participants' knowledge of and skills as leaders in their chosen field and improve their existing skill sets, and aims to address the gap in women accessing Leadership roles.

Cherifa Atoussi, who designed the programme along with her colleagues, said there “has always been an appetite for a programme like this, one that is created by minority ethnic women for minority ethnic women.”

Cherifa added that one woman who graduated from the course told her that it helped her better understand her own values as well as “feminist leadership values”.   

Account3 has invited all women residents of Tower Hamlets, who identify as Black, Asian and or ethnically diverse, and who ‘want to contribute to a positive change in the wider community’ to register. 

The course will aim to “build local capacity and resilience” by providing resources to women who would like to be leaders in their chosen fields. 

Account3’s work is predicated on the belief that all women deserve economic independence, and it seeks to specifically empower those women facing multiple disadvantages.

The programme seeks to specifically empower those women facing multiple disadvantages, and all women in Tower Hamlets who identify as  Black, Asian and or ethnically diverse, are invited to register.  

Account3  is headed by a diverse group of professionals who make up its board, and their volunteers speak several languages meaning the range of nationalities in Tower Hamlets can be reached through its work.
