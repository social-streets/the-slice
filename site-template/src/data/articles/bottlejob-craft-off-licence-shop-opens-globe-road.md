BottleJob, a new bottle shop and craft off-licence, has opened in Globe Town on Globe Road, offering locals a range of craft beers, wines and spirits under one roof. 

BottleJob places equal value on supplying wine, beer and spirits to take away, providing local customers with a wider range than most off-licences or supermarkets but with an emphasis on local suppliers.

The shop stocks beers from local brewers such as Five Points, and wines from local suppliers including [Nekter Wines](https://www.nekterwines.com/) based on Cyprus Street, and Ester Wines from Shadwell. Spirits come from as far as Australia, as well as local distillations from [East London Liquor Company](https://romanroadlondon.com/alex-wolpert-east-london-liquor-company/).

The shop, which some may remember when it was the knitting shop Prick Your Finger,  is the brainchild of Alex Dehayen, founder of South American and Spanish restaurant [Chiringuito](https://romanroadlondon.com/chiringuito-cafe-opens-museum-gardens/) on Cambridge Heath Road. 

BottleJob is an off-licence, meaning its bottles are sold to take away, but Dehayen plans to open the space up to evening events ‘where people can get involved and chat to our staff and each other about the drinks’.

Continuing the local focus, BottleJob’s sign was painted by local sign painter [Luminor](https://romanroadlondon.com/ged-palmer-luminor-sign-co/), and the fighter plane graphic was created by Old Street designer Glyphics. ‘I like trying to do things locally, my businesses are small and all focused around the area,’ Dehayen said.

Dehayen himself is a born and bred East Londoner with strong connections to the local area, with his parents and grandparents having grown up in Bethnal Green and Stepney. He has lived in Bethnal Green for the last 15 years and has recently moved nearer Victoria Park.

BottleJob’s decor is inspired by midcentury, prohibition themes, with a vintage rotary-style telephone, wooden barstools and Peaky Blinders-esque background music.

The name of the shop comes from a Cockney rhyming slang expression used to mean ‘coward’, which Dehayen recalled was his grandfather’s affectionate nickname for him. 

‘My nan and grandad had their first date in the Old Globe pub, which is now the Ladbrokes at the end of Globe Road, so it’s a nod to my granddad, his connections and my connections to the area.’

The shop’s logo, a fighter plane with bottles for bombs, contrasts a sense of bravery and adventure with the Cockney connotation of ‘coward’, which shares its root with the term ‘to bottle it’.

BottleJob opened its doors to Globe Town on 1 October 2019 and is open from 4pm to 11pm on weekdays, and midday to 11pm on weekends, with plans to open the shop on weekday afternoons as well.
