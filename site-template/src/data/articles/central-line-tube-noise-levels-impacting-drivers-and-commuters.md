Regular commuters won’t be surprised when they hear which stretch of the Central Line is the noisiest, but why is this and what’s being done about it?

In June 2024 Transport for London (TFL) released data showing concerning noise levels on Central Line’s East End routes, which continue to affect commuters and drivers. 

This TFL study, published annually, revealed that on the eastbound tracks of the Central Line, the highest recorded decibels were between Stratford and Leyton at 95dB closely followed by Liverpool to Bethnal Green at 87 dB.  

Travelling on the Tube is a daily routine for Londoners but as many residents have attested, the expected noise from the trains is becoming unbearable resulting in earaches and the need for ear protection. 

When travelling eastbound from Liverpool Street to Leytonstone, the noise doesn't go under 80 dB.  When commuting westbound these stretches of the Central Line are slightly quieter with Leyton to Stratford at 77dB and Bethnal Green to Liverpool Street at 86 dB. 

The full decibel levels on the Central Line can be found on the [TFL website](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/transparency/freedom-of-information/foi-request-detail?referenceId=FOI-1231-2425).

TFL’s internal Noise and Vibration team carry out monitoring in train operator cabs on a bi-monthly period. Results are published annually, and this year’s figures show a slight decrease from last year when Stratford and Leyton levels were at 115 dB.  

This means that East London commuters experience noise at levels of a rock concert, which belts out an average of 90 and 120 dB. 

According to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), 85dB is the maximum safety level of noise for long-term exposure. Decibels are measured logarithmically, which means that sound intensity doubles with every increase of 3dB, halving the safe exposure time. 

So if our calculations are correct the safe exposure time for 100dB would be 37 mins. 

According to TFL data more than 1,300 noise complaints were made between January 2020 and August 2022. 

It’s not just commuters who are suffering. Tube drivers on the Victoria Line have voted to take strike action in the form of reducing the speed of their trains to protest the noise levels they are exposed to. 

The Victoria Line has become one of the other noisest tube lines alongside the Central Line with a [sound test carried out by the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ced0d869e13o) measuring up to 112.3 dB. 

The London Underground Ltd has now instructed all Victoria Line drivers to wear ear-defenders. However, drivers say this solution is unsuitable as it prevents them from hearing alerts of incidents from the train radio. 

The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers announced on 24 October 2024 that they are demanding LUL to take urgent action to mitigate noise. 

Central Line East branch said ‘The increase in noise levels on the Central Line are extremely uncomfortable and distressing for our drivers.

‘This branch is ready to take action to protect our drivers who wish to drive manually at a reduced speed.’ 

On a Facebook post about the issue, Peter C said: ‘Bethnal Green on the eastbound approach is ear-splitting, as are both directions from Stratford to Leyton’ 

Melvina M shared a similar opinion saying: ‘I find from Bethnal Green up to Leyton is really bad. Sunday morning was terrible, I had an earache when I got off.’ 

This seems to be an issue for many people with Suzy L commenting: ‘I’ve noticed that area of the line seems to be getting louder. I frequently have to put my hands over my ears to protect them’.  

So what exactly makes the tube so noisy? It’s mostly down to something called corrugation.

Longwave corrugation is rail roughness caused by repeated acceleration and braking. This type of noise tends to cause residential noise more than in-tunnel noise. 

Shortwave corrugation is caused the same way but results in in-tunnel noise for train operators and customers. 

Curves on the tracks also contribute to the corrugation and result in the screeching sound we all hate. 

TFL is aware of these issues and has some techniques to attempt to resolve the issue including rail grinding which is a process that has to be repeated at regular intervals to see results.
