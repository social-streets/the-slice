York Hall might be the home of East End boxing, but last weekend the stars of Mexican Lucha Libre fought for glory in the wrestling ring.

Boxing is inextricable from the East End. From English heavyweight champion [Daniel Mendoza](https://romanroadlondon.com/daniel-mendoza-jewish-history/), who penned _The Art of Boxing_ in 1792, to Joe Anderson, who was crowned ‘All-England’ champion in 1897, Bethnal Green’s history of fighting dates back centuries. 

[The boxing ring at York Hall](https://romanroadlondon.com/york-hall-boxing-heritage-bethnal-green/) on Old Ford Road has been the stage where many stars rose to prominence. Former world champion David Haye had his first fight at the arena, and in 1995 Joe Calzaghe famously took down Frank Minton in an unthinkable 85 seconds. 

But last weekend, it wasn’t about boxing. Hundreds of spectators gathered on Sunday afternoon for a full day of breathtaking theatrics, as a line-up of masked Mexican fighters fought it out Lucha Libre style. 

Lucha Libre, which translates as ‘free fighting’, originated in Mexico in the early 20th century. Characterised by super-hero masks, exuberant costumes and unthinkable acrobatic stunts, the theatrical sport is a feast for the senses.

Like in American wrestling, matches are won when an opponent is pinned to the floor for a count of three or knocked out of the ring for a count of generally twenty. 

_Luchadores_ are famed for agility, allowing their dizzying ‘high-flying’ ariel feats. Compared to professional wrestlers in the United States, where it’s more about hard strikes and power, Mexican fighters must be masters of nimble flexibility when leaping between the ring’s posts and ropes.

On Sunday, York Hall welcomed 15 renowned Lucha Libre athletes into its wrestling ring, including Mistico, the current NWA World Historic Middleweight Champion and son of Miguel Urive, who fought under the ring name Dr. Karonte. As is customary among _luchadores_, Mistico is part of an extended wrestling family and the spectacular sport runs in his blood.

Father and son duo Atlantis and Atlantis Junior also entered the arena. Soon into his wrestling career, the younger man revealed his familial connection through donning the same mask as his elder. He keeps his real name a secret, as is customary among many _luchadores._ 

Chilean wrestler Stephanie Vaquer, the current CMLL World Women's Champion, also graced York Hall with her acrobatic stunts, defying gravity as she flew across the ring. 

If you couldn’t make it last Sunday, fear not. Local photographer Matt Payne captured some of the most jaw-dropping moments from the action-packed event, from mid-air bouts to kneck-and-kneck scrambles.
