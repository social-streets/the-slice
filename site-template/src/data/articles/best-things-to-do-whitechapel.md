Whitechapel is home to many sites of cultural heritage, local talent and some of London’s best independent Bangladeshi eateries. The area’s history is uniquely multicultural and it is the perfect place to appreciate the British Bangladeshi community.

Whether you’re just visiting the area or have lived here for years, Whitechapel has so much to do around every corner. There’s plenty of entertainment venues, eateries offering varied cuisines and intriguing history to be discovered. From the architectural gems both new and old, to some of the biggest markets Tower Hamlets operating throughout the week, Whitechapel is full of things to see and do**.**

## Altab Ali Park

Located between Whitechapel Road and Commercial Road, Altab Ali park is a large green space offering Whitechapel’s visitors a refreshing escape from the surrounding city.

In 1998, the park was renamed in memory of Altab Ali, a 25-year-old Bangladeshi resident of Whitechapel. Walking home through Adler Street on 4 May 1978, he was murdered in an unprovoked racially-motivated attack by three teenage boys. This kind of violent racism was common in the East End at that time.

The park is a celebration of shared cultures and represents a better era for Whitechapel where everyone is welcome. Written on the central path is a verse from Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore: “The shade of my tree is offered to those who come and go fleetingly”.

The Altab Ali Park is the heart of Whitechapel, a great place for picnics, hanging out or just a quick coffee for locals and visitors alike.
