Photographer Becky Frances captures beautiful and bizarre sights of Bethnal Green in her work.

Street photographer Becky Frances has travelled around London capturing the capital city through her lens. Bethnal Green is no exception with Becky Frances having snapped every day people who make up our area, from pensioners to hipsters.

Her photos are often busy, whether she has captured a high-street scene, or a marketplace, the backdrops can be almost chaotic. However, Frances' work often brings the viewer's eye to one particular subject. These subjects are rarely posed, captured mid-movement in their daily comings and goings.

Looking at the background of each photo, we can deduce something about the subject. For example, the older lady waving down a bus on Bethnal Green Road, makes you feel like she is a native of the high street and perhaps has spent a majority of her life in the area. Part of the joy of Frances's photography is that the scenery around the subject allows you to construct a story around them.

She has a knack for capturing intriguing characters in her photography. For example, the market trader dressed in fur and the hipsters in their glasses are adorned in distinctive outfits that make them stand out from a crowd.

Frances chooses her subjects carefully, her photos make you want to know more about each character; for example, you might wonder about the couple kissing in front of the graffiti artists, have they just met recently, what brought them to that seemingly random spot?
