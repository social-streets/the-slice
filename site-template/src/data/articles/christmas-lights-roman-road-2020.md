Every year, the shops, pubs and residents alike around Roman Road unabashedly get into the Christmas spirit as twinkling festive lights and displays pop up all over our streets. This year, when we are experiencing many changes to our usual December festivities, our enduring community spirit shines through, quite literally, with our light displays.

Who for instance, has seen the hologram of Santa Claus on the window of the house on Annie Besant Close? And let us not forget the rainbows and signs of support for the NHS that have appeared among the twinkling fairy lights, as well as the impressive Christmas tree outside the Idea Store adorned with decorations made by local primary school children.

We can certainly do with every bit of light in these admittedly dark times, which is why we have sent local photographer Phil Verney to capture the best Christmas lights around the Roman Road area.
