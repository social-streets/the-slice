A new Asda Express convenience store has opened on Bow Road, as the supermarket commits to becoming the second-largest grocery retailer in the UK. 

A new Asda Express has replaced the Co-op convenience store attached to the petrol station at 131 Bow Road, as part of the supermarket’s goal to reach 1,000 UK stores in total for the first time.

The express store opened on Friday 2 February, and can be found on the east side of the Bow Road bridge next to the Little Driver pub and the William Hill betting shop.

The Co-op was loved by residents around the Bow Quarter area, who relied on the 24-hour convenience store for their daily essentials on the way back from work. Luckily, the new Asda Express also remains open 24 hours, and stocks around 3,000 branded and own-label products.

The Asda Express is the newest addition to Bow’s range of grocery retailers, which include Akdeniz Supermarket and Best Food Centre on Roman Road and Tesco Express on Vernon Road, among others. The nearest Asda supermarket is a 30-minute walk away in Stepney Green.

Other local supermarkets include the Co-op underneath The Green Bridge near Mile End tube station and Lidl on Burdett Road.

In January, Asda announced it would price match both Aldi and Lidl on 287 core grocery products and has reduced prices by an average of 17%. 

As part of a multi-million-pound investment, the retailer has acquired 470 former convenience stores from the Co-op and EG Group which it plans to convert to Asda Express stores by the end of March.

Asda aims to break records by opening 110 express stores throughout February to accelerate its growth in convenience and put it on track to becoming the second-largest grocery retailer in the UK. 

The small stores are geared towards consumers grabbing lunch on the go or in need of daily essentials like milk and bread. 

Andy Perry, Asda’s Vice President of Convenience, said: ‘Asda’s significant investment in building a nationwide chain of convenience stores is a key component of our long-term strategy to become the number two player in UK grocery.’

He added: ‘February is a transformational month for programme with a record number of store openings and conversion of all former Co-op sites to Asda Express sites. 

‘The teams have worked at pace to reach this point and we look forward to bringing Asda’s quality and low prices to many more communities across the UK.’
