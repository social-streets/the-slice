Labour's Rushana Ali won by a sliver in the hotly contested seat of Bethnal Green & Stepney with independent Ajmal Masroor close behind. See the full results.

This morning, the news was out that Sir Keir Starmer had made history and won the general election with a landslide, but who did the people of Bethnal Green & Stepney vote for here in Tower Hamlets?

It was a tight race in this constituency. We knew there was a concerted campaign by independent [Ajmal Masroor to topple Labour and get rid of Rushanara Ali](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/independent-ajmal-masroor-overthrow-labour-rushanara-ali-bethnal-green-stepney/), who has been MP for Bethnal Green and Bow (now Bethnal Green and Stepney) since 2010. 

Back in 2019, Rushanara Ali won 72.7% of votes and had a majority of 37,524, but this year there wasn't a lot separating her from Masroor. Here are the final results.

Labour’s share of votes in Bethnal Green and Stepney was down by 39.4% since 2019, but Ali has kept her position after a dramatic six weeks, winning a majority of 1,689.

Across the borough, we've seen independent candidates like Fiona Lali in Stratford and Bow launch some impassioned, anti-Labour campaigns, but they didn't translate into significant votes. On the other hand, in Bethnal Green and Stepney, Masroor and his pro-Palestinian supporters posed a real threat to Ali, fracturing her majority.

In Bethnal Green and Stepney, turnout was the highest across Tower Hamlets’ three constituencies at 57% but had still decreased by 8% since the last election in 2019. Nationally, voter turnout was significantly low compared to the last general election, declining from 67.3% in 2019 to 60% yesterday.

## 2024 results across Tower Hamlets

While Rushanara Ali clung on by a slim margin in Bethnal Green & Stepney, it was a more convincing win for Labour in the other two constituencies in Tower Hamlets. In Stratford & Bow, Labour's Uma Kumaran won by a margin of 11,634. In Poplar & Limehouse, Labour's Apsana Begum won by a margin of 12,560. There wasn't a concerted pro-Palestinian campaign to defeat Kumaran and Begum in the same way that there was against Ali, who abstained from a Gaza ceasefire vote in November last year.

## Historic election results

In 2024, we have a new constituency of Bethnal Green & Stepney. In previous years this was Bethnal Green & Bow. Looking back over the last six general elections in Bethnal Green & Bow, we see a Labour stronghold throughout except for 2005, when George Galloway as the Respect candidate beat Labour's Oona King by appealing to the anti-war spirit in Tower Hamlets during the Iraq war.
