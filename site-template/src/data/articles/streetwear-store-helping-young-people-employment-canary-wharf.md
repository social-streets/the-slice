Circle Collective has launched a streetwear store in Canary Wharf that will help 250 unemployed young people in Tower Hamlets access employment opportunities 

Circle Collective, a London-based social enterprise that helps unemployed young people get into permanent work, has opened its third physical store in the Lower Mall at Jubilee Place in Canary Wharf. 

The retail space has been provided free of charge by Canary Wharf Group as part of its broader social impact strategy and the store is staffed by young people seeking work experience.

The store will sell own-brand merchandise, vintage clothing and homeware including global streetwear brands such as Eastpak, Dickies, Kickers and Fila.   

The young people’s work experience will include customer service, product knowledge, cash handling and timekeeping which will enable them to learn core transferable skills to further help them find permanent employment.

Proceeds from every store sale will be used to fund the “back your future” employability course for those aged 16-30 who face barriers to employment, run from the premises by Circle Collective’s sister charity Circle Community. The Canary Wharf base is expected to help 250 young people into work. 

In addition to selling streetwear, the retail space will be used for workshops, pop-ups, art shows and ticketed events. Also, clothing adjustments and shoe cleaning will be available in-store.

 Emma Warden, Associate Director, CSR & Community at Canary Wharf Group comments:  

‘Youth employment remains one of the most prominent issues locally and nationally as unemployment figures rose to 5% in the past year. Using our position as a connector and owner of space, this partnership forms part of our wider vision to create lasting social impact through meaningful collaborations with community partners, our customers and our own people.’ 

 Turly Humphreys, CEO of Circle Collective comments:  

‘We are so excited about being donated this wonderful space in such a prestigious location. Our young team and trainees are bolstered with confidence. Our customers are shocked that such a unique and beautiful store holds such a strong mission and vision, we have already had people offering to volunteer and mentor our trainees and corporates offering entry level jobs.’
