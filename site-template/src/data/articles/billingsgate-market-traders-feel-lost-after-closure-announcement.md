Poplar's famous fish market traders expressed their concerns following the announcement of the market closure.

Tony Lyons has been selling fish at Billingsgate Fish Market for 37 years. His daughter is also heavily involved in the business – A. A. Lyons – and he is the proud chairman of the London Fish Merchants Association.

On November 27, he had a particular concern on his mind: 'I’m saddened by the fact that at this moment in time, people are going to think that London is not going to have a fish market.'

Mr Lyons was referring to the City of London Corporation’s decision to close both Smithfield and Billingsgate markets in a secret Court of Common Council meeting on Tuesday, November 26.

At that meeting, the Corporation agreed to cancel a proposed relocation of the historic markets, plus eventually move New Spitalfields in Leyton to a new purpose-built facility in Dagenham.

The Corporation also agreed to pay compensation to traders at Smithfield and Billingsgate to vacate the sites and enable them to be put to other uses.

The plan is for Smithfield to be turned into a mixed-use cultural destination including the new London Museum, and for Billingsgate to be redeveloped for homes.

A market has existed in Smithfield since the medieval period. It was revamped as a wholesale meat market in the 1860s and is today the largest of its kind in the UK. Billingsgate meanwhile moved from the City to its current site by Canary Wharf in the early 1980s and is the country’s biggest inland fish market.

To officially withdraw from running the markets the Corporation deposited a Private Bill with Parliament on November 27. This will then go before either the House of Commons or the House of Lords in January, and if the bill has Parliament’s backing, will enable the Corporation to de-marketise Smithfield and Billingsgate.

In a press release issued after yesterday’s meeting, the Chair of Policy and Resources and de-facto political leader of the Corporation, Deputy Chris Hayward, said the approval represents a ‘positive new chapter’ for the markets and that traders will receive support to move to new locations.

He said: 'By stepping back from direct market operations, we will help to create opportunities for these businesses to thrive independently. We’ve worked closely with the traders and thank them for their input and understanding. We’re committed to making sure they have the financial support and guidance they need to transition seamlessly and successfully to new locations.'

The City said operations will continue at Smithfield and Billingsgate until at least 2028.

The feeling among traders at Billingsgate however appeared more mixed when the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) visited this morning. One, who did not wish to give his name, said the history of the markets plus concerns about food security raised questions about the decision to close both sites.

They said the proposed relocation to the new facility in Dagenham appeared ideal to secure the future of the markets. 'There’s been no major investment in \[Billingsgate\] and they needed to move. Composite sites for markets is the way to go.'

They added the design process behind the relocation had been ‘pretty poor’, and that the news that the markets would potentially close had been a ‘bombshell’ for traders.

In terms of what happens next, they said there are particular considerations for those operating at Billingsgate, which is a wet market and well-suited for the sale of fish.

'We really need to be in an environment that’s designed for this,' they said, later adding: 'It’s not as straightforward as the Corporation is saying.'

Scott Unwin at Bobby’s Fish told the LDRS he is yet to get his head around the decision. 'It hasn’t hit home yet,' he said. 'We are still a bit upset.'

He said traders understood things had to change due to operating in an old building, though they had initially believed they would be moving to a ‘beautiful state-of-the-art market’.

'These markets were built to feed the people of London. All this \[has been\] going on with the farmers and that,' he said. 'To take it away was a bit of a bombshell.'

Asked about his future plans, he said: 'Where do we go from here? I haven’t got an answer to that.'

Mr Lyons struck a more optimistic tone on the future for the Billingsgate market, though did express concerns about the closure of the existing site.

He said when he found out over the summer that the move to Dagenham was cancelled, he was ‘absolutely gutted’. He added: 'We had a big involvement in the planning of it, it would have given us a state-of-the-art place to trade from, it would have given us a facility that we need.'

Following yesterday’s decision he said: 'I’m saddened by the fact that at this moment in time people are going to think that London is not going to have a fish market.'

Mr Lyons however said he remains hopeful. He said he is confident there will be interest from companies wanting to retain the market in some form.

He also suggested that moving away from being under the ownership of the City of London may have its benefits, with there being occasional issues getting decisions finalised by the Corporation’s hierarchy of committees.

Asked about the future of Billingsgate, he said: 'It’s not just about me. This is an institution, and it has to keep going.'

Margaret Mullane, MP for Dagenham and Rainham, said she has made clear to the City that any alternative plans for the East London site must be based on the creation of good opportunities for local people.

She said: 'I was pleased that the City of London Corporation gave a commitment to work closely on their plans with Barking and Dagenham Council and me for the development of the site. They were also clear that their thinking is to generate businesses and well paying jobs for our area. I can confirm that I will be very closely monitoring developments to ensure that Dagenham and local residents benefit.'

The MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, Rachel Blake, said: 'Smithfield Market is a key historic site and an important part of the City of London’s heritage.

'As the site transforms, I believe that this heritage should be enhanced and protected, and expect to see that plans brought forward to create a new cultural and commercial hub reflect Smithfield’s historical importance, securing jobs and a cultural legacy in the heart of the capital.

'It’s also vital that the Corporation of London now works closely with traders and local representatives to make sure that the Dagenham site creates jobs and growth for London.'
