In a list compiled by The Evening Standard, Hackney Wick’s very own Lord Napier Star was voted one of the best rooftop bars in London. Here’s why…

‘Original Gem’, ‘A brilliant mix of quirky, alternative and industrial’, ‘Iconic Hackney Wick pub’.

These are just a few reviews from customers who have visited Lord Napier Star.

In 2020, Hackney Wick’s beloved [Lord Napier Star went under renovation](https://romanroadlondon.com/lord-napier-star-pub-opens/). After being closed for 26 years, and reopening as Electric Star pub’s eighth venture, it needed a bit of TLC. The well-loved exterior - a result of a 48-hour takeover by a team of 29 local artists - remained completely untouched. However, the inside became almost unrecognisable, and brand sparkly new.

And all the hard work has paid off. Last week, the rushed commuter’s go-to paper, [The Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/reveller/bars/londons-best-rooftop-bars-b996396.html), listed Lord Napier Star as one of the best rooftop bars in the capital. It noted that ‘now restored, the graffiti covered boozer, most famous for its ‘shithouse to penthouse’ tag, is still crumbling outside but all shiny and new inside’. With the summer months approaching, it is no wonder that rooftop bars are becoming more popular.

So why Lord Napier Star? 

There’s no surprise that Lord Napier Star has become popular, with its jazzy bar and fantastic selection of cocktails. These include Margaritas, Aperol Spritz and craft pints - it’s no wonder everyone is raving!

The spacious, groovy rooftop has a lovely balcony with views of Hackney below. Not only that, but the rooftop allows you to see all the artwork of Hackney Wick, as far as Stratford and the city. The rooftop is open and exposed to the sun, making it the perfect summer hangout. Covered with funky wall paintings and fairy lights, it’s the perfect place to sit and have a drink with your mates, whoever you are. 

The pub pulls in a huge variety of customers and locals. These include, West Ham fans coming from the stadium down the road, the locals looking for an evening pint, and what the pub describes as ‘retired ravers’.

But it is not only the decor and drinks that holds appeal. Lord Napier Star hosts a number of themed nights in the week, including; Margarita Monday, Quiz night on Tuesday, Curry night on Wednesday, DJ nights Friday and Saturday and even Sunday Roasts. So whatever mood you are in, there is a night for you.

It is no surprise that Hackney Wick’s Lord Napier Star has been voted one of the best rooftop bars in London. With its great views, extensive food menu, delicious cocktails and DJ lineup, it’s a local, and clearly now London-wide hotspot!
