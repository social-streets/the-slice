With a line-up full of rising stars, mouthwatering food and more, Greentea Peng co-curates Poplar Union’s upcoming Bazaar to celebrate Black History Month

Coming up on October 19th, the Black Legacy Xchange Bazaar with Poplar Union combines market and food stalls, musical performances and arts activities. 

The Bazaar will celebrate Black History Month by platforming black creatives and artisans and is being co-curated by popular musician Greentea Peng.

Hailing from South East London and with over a million monthly listeners on Spotify, Greentea is a psychedelic RnB and trip-hop artist with a sultry, uplifting voice. She’s called Tower Hamlets a home base for over a decade and is also a passionate chef and community organiser, which she calls a vital part of her creative practice.

‘The intention is to hold space for people in difficult times, uplift each other, celebrate each other, and celebrate community.’ Greentea said, ‘Market places for me are one of my natural habitats so it was fun for me to jump on board.’ 

Greentea drew on her roots in the area to choose performers and vendors for the day, handpicking creators from the East End which she knows personally as well as putting out an open call with Poplar Union to find unsung talents. 

The line-up of ten musicians includes jazz artist Muva of Earth, MC Eklipse and rapper and singer Hak Baker (we might also get a sneak performance from Greentea). Stall-holders will include everyone from artisanal leather workers to DIY political punks. It’s a promising line-up, borne of Greentea’s combination of music industry know-how and love of her neighbourhood. 

For snacks, there will be food available from E5, Poplar Union's in-house cafe. Food will also be on sale from plant-based Indian-fusion restaurant En Root. The exclusive menu will feature Jerk mushroom Tandoori Wings and a homemade Mango Lassi. 

It’s a rare and precious thing to see free community programming with a line-up to rival expensive day festivals. For Greentea, the motivation was simple: ‘I love my community, I love London, I want people to be happy.’ 

The Bazaar is the first event in an ongoing partnership Greentea is establishing with Poplar Union, where she intends to continue hosting events such as supper clubs. ‘I’ve always had that humanitarian fire within me since  was a child,’ Greentea said, ‘At some point, you have to start giving back to the environment that is helping you thrive.’
