Environmental group Extinction Rebellion ran three days of workshops, exhibitions, and nonviolent protests last weekend as part of its East London Uprising.

The weekend kicked off with a march from Paradise Gardens to Hackney Town Hall. Hundreds gathered for the march, which concluded with a children's assembly, where children were asked for their perspective on air pollution and how it should be addressed.

The assembly was held by Alfie Castel-O'Leary and Rachel Ellman. Ellman said: 'We're helping to amplify their voices, because children are real leaders in the movement, but they can't vote.'

She hopes the East London Uprising will have proven constructive. 'It's about solutions, education, coming together as a community to create the culture that we need to have a liveable planet,' she said.

Castel-O'Leary said: 'Currently not much is being done. We've had places declare climate emergencies, but that's not enough they need action.'

Nearly 9,500 people die early in London each year due to long-term air pollution exposure, according to [a 2015 study by King's College London](https://www.scribd.com/document/271641490/King-s-College-London-report-on-mortality-burden-of-NO2-and-PM2-5-in-London).

Other events that ran over the weekend included a skeleton procession, music and workshops at London Fields, and road blocks in Stratford and Dalston.
