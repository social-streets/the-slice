All Points East is returning for its third edition on 27 to 30 August, joining forces with Field Day to conclude the festivities on the Sunday.

Headline acts for [All Points East](https://romanroadlondon.com/all-points-east-festival-victoria-park-east-london/) have now been announced by every day including Jorja Smith on Friday, Kano on Saturday, Field Day on Sunday and regulars Bombay Bicyle Club on Monday.

To compensate for the noise and crowds experienced by residents living closest to the park (a good or bad thing depending on your point of view) London Borough of Tower Hamlets will be running the annual residents ticket draw again, providing free tickets to the festival for a lucky few.

The catchment area will remain the same as 2019 so that the residents closest to the park and most affected by the events have the opportunity to benefit.

As previously, the same number of tickets will be issued per event day. If or when the capacity is increased, the number of tickets available will increase proportionally.

How do you apply? Residents in eligible roads marked in pink on the map will receive a letter by mid-June, so keep an eye out for the letter from the Council.
