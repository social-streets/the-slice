The big day is fast approaching, and the buzz around the office Christmas party is building but where’s the best spot in East London to celebrate?

It’s that time of year again when the dreams of crispy turkey and goose fat roasties have started and the big decision is where to go for a slap-up Christmas dinner, either on the day itself or in the run-up. 

Nothing beats a home-cooked meal but in London, not many of us have the space to host or the time to organise it. Luckily, East London has plenty of venues that will bring Christmas on a plate to you and your friends, family or work colleagues.  

Our guide to Christmas dining in Tower Hamlets includes something for everyone, from traditional gastropubs and festive karaoke nights to more formal sit-down meals.

All venues recommend booking as soon as possible to avoid disappointment. 

Not looking for a five-star sit-down extravaganza? Many caffs and takeaways will be putting on festive Twists and we like the sound of the turkey toastie and sweet festive favours at Ole & Steen Danish Bakery in Canary Wharf.

Flat Earth Pizzas, known for their sustainable and award-winning pizzas are taking their well-loved pizzas and adding some festive twists. They have two set lunch menus either for Christmas team meals or family festivities

To pair with the celebrations, enjoy Pét Nat, a sparkling wine which unlike traditional champagnes finishes their fermentation in the bottle and is a softer drink with a purer fruiter flavour. 

The Christmas Lunch set menu suitable for work parties is £23pp, available until 5 pm. The festive feast set menu is £33pp suitable for family-style get-togethers. 

The Christmas menus will be served from November 12 to December 22.
