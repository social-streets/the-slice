A gem of a café in Globe Town, [Sazzy & Fran](https://sazzyandfran.co.uk/cafe) serves a small but perfect selection of teas. Delivered from Scottish tea house Jenier, sip on an English Breakfast while enjoying peanut butter on toast with banana and maple syrup on a quiet Sunday morning. We also think that its jasmine tea is an ideal partner to the café’s acclaimed acai bowl while sitting on a window barstool and surrounded by the calming effect of its plants. A blissful way to start any day.

Sit here with an aromatic Earl Grey or try a South African favourite, sweet Rooibos. There is also jasmine tea, peppermint, and a gorgeously sounding rose pomegranate white tea. Bring a friend or two and share a pot. Enjoy these with one of the cafés sweet or savoury crêpes, and watch a slice of the Roman Road life go.

[Mae + Harvey](https://www.maeandharvey.com/) carries on its tradition of carefully curating its produce through its colourful collection of teas. Its teas are from Zigzag, a British-founded tea company whose offices are based a couple of miles west in Whitechapel. Try their loose-leaf jasmine green tea, or the romantically sounding lavender rose and chamomile tea. Mae + Harvey’s owner, Natasha Sayliss, has also gone about creating her own aromatic in-house chai, with a blend of cardamom pods, star anise and fresh ginger peel. The café’s no laptops policy combined with a cosy atmosphere makes it ideal for a digital detox while enjoying your clean-living cup of tea.

A Roman Road stalwart, [Cafe Créme](https://www.cafecremebow.co.uk/) serves up sandwiches, soups, and fry-ups all day. But their tea, for a mere £1, will leave you warm and content. No frills nor froth, just a good old English brew. Sit in-house for a tea and a treat or, if you are in a hurry, get it to takeaway. A nice touch if you opt to takeaway: the servers add a little drop of cold water so you aren’t left with an angry tongue that has been scalded red hot.
