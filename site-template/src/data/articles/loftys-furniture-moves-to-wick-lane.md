Lofty's beloved furniture shop is saying 'goodbye' to Roman Road and 'hello' to a bigger stock space in Wick Lane.

The furniture shop, which had an eleven year run on the Roman, was impossible to miss in its prime spot. Well known for the lines of colourful, bright velvet and leather plush sofas spilling out of the shop front on sunny days, they'll be sorely missed by all walking through the market.

Lofty's sells high-end products at market-comfortable prices, with the stock being end of range products, cancelled orders, and overruns.

The [shop's main claim to fame](https://romanroadlondon.com/loftys-furniture-shop/) is easily the BBC show Flipping Profit, where Tony Wong, the face of Lofty's, featured in four episodes to raise money for Children in Need.

Wong, who has worked there for nine years, tells us why they're moving: 'It's sad to leave this location, and the [Market](https://romanroadlondon.com/market/), but the move is really about space. We want our customers to be able to see the stock more easily.'

Their new location on [Fish Island](https://romanroadlondon.com/history-fish-island/), 429 Wick Lane, is certainly bigger, and gives them a whole warehouse space to play around with. It will mean a more comfortable shopping experience, which is Lofty's real aim.

Although weaseling your way around the carefully stacked and placed furniture gave the shop a certain charm, they'll be grateful for more breathing space.

Tony Wong tells us he considers the move to be a really great opportunity, and isn't afraid of losing customers. 'It's only 10 minutes down the road, and we feel confident that people know who we are, we have so many returning customers who won't be fazed.'

Customers are familiar with seeing Lofty's all across social media, with their limited stock products on Instagram ([@loftysfurniture](https://www.instagram.com/loftysfurniture/?hl=en)) and Facebook.

As for what is going to replace it? For now it remains a mystery. Keep an eye out for upcoming news pieces.
