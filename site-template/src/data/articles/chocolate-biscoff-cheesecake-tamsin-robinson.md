This is the fourth recipe in our series of quarantine cooking recipes – flexible dishes where you can add, subtract and adapt almost any of the ingredients you buy locally – from **Tamsin Robinson**.

This cheesecake sounds incredible right? Better yet, it doesn't require any pesky flour, which has become increasingly hard to get hold of.

Local pastry chef and recent graduate of Le Cordon Bleu, Tamsin Robinson has whipped up a white chocolate and Biscoff cheesecake lathered in a nectarine and ginger compote just in time for the warmer weather.

You can swap so many of the ingredients in this one: get creative with your biscuit base, try out a different (yet just as indulgent) spread like Nutella, or use another stoned fruit to make the compote . Robinson used nectarines as they are _just_ coming into season, so they may be a little underripe in the shops but still work great in this recipe, adding a fresh, fruity twist to a rich cheesecake.

This recipe makes an 8" cheesecake. Biscoff spread is quite a specific ingredient, but it can usually be found next to the Nutella in all bigger supermarkets and well-stocked grocery shops.

#### Ingredients

**Cheesecake**

240g gingernut biscuits

100g unsalted butter

210g white chocolate

210g double cream

210g full-fat cream cheese

125g Biscoff spread

**Fruit compote**

2-3 (underripe) nectarines

50g caster sugar

30 ml water

10g fresh ginger, finely sliced or grated

½ tsp vanilla bean paste

#### Adaptions

- _Biscuit base_ - Gingernuts can be substituted for any robust biscuit e.g. digestives, hobnobs, or Biscoff biscuits themselves. 
- _Chocolate_ - This cheesecake is best with white chocolate but can be made with milk or dark too. If using dark chocolate, you only need 165g chocolate instead of 210g, and add 20g more Biscoff spread.
- _Fruit topping_ - Other stone fruit or strawberries can be used to make the compote. If you are using strawberries, only use 10 ml water because a lot of juice will come out of the fruit. 
- _Flavour_ - If you can’t find Biscoff spread, you can use smooth peanut butter or Nutella to make equally delicious cheesecakes. Peanut butter can be paired with any chocolate, but Nutella works best with milk or dark chocolate. If making these variations, top with a strawberry compote or even just fresh raspberries.  

#### Method

First make the base. Crush the biscuits into fine crumbs using a food processor, or a rolling pin and a bowl.  

Melt the butter and combine with the crushed biscuits. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of an 8” loose round bottom tin, and leave to chill in the fridge for at least an hour.

Next make the filling. Melt the chocolate and Biscoff spread together in a heatproof bowl. You can either do this in the microwave on a low setting or by placing the bowl over a pan of simmering water on the stove, ensuring the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water.

Once melted, give it a good stir and leave to cool for five minutes.

Using a hand whisk, mix the double cream and cream cheese together in a large bowl. Keep mixing until the mixture becomes smooth and thick, but not too stiff. 

Pour the chocolate mixture into the bowl, and mix until well combined.

Pour the cheesecake filling over the top of the chilled biscuit base. Level out with the back of a spoon and leave to set in the fridge for at least two hours.

Make the compote while the cheesecake is chilling. Start by slicing up the nectarine into bite-sized chunks or slices. 

Place the sugar, water and ginger in a medium saucepan and heat until the sugar has fully dissolved. Note: If you grate the ginger, you will get a much more intense flavour. 

Turn the heat to the lowest setting, then add in the vanilla and sliced nectarines. Gently cook the nectarines until they have softened. This should take around 4-5 mins, but will depend on the ripeness of the nectarines. 

Once soft, turn off the heat and leave to cool fully in the saucepan. 

When you are ready to serve, demould the cheesecake from the tin and spoon over the nectarines. There should be some syrup left too, which can also be drizzled over the cheesecake.
