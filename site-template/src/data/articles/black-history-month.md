Black History Month has started with this year's theme ‘Reclaiming Narratives’ promising a dynamic lineup of events across the area.   

Every October Tower Hamlets celebrates its diversity bringing communities together in honor of Black History Month. We have compiled our best picks from ballet to bazaars for you to enjoy. 

This year’s theme, ‘Reclaiming Narratives’, encourages people to correct narratives, become new storytellers and uncover untold stories within Black history and culture. 

In line with this, and in time for Black History Month, the Vagina Museum is honouring the ‘Mothers of Gynaecology’ with new galleries dedicated to Anarcha, Betsey, and Lucy—the only three of twelve women whose names were recorded after being subjected to experimental surgeries without anaesthesia and in front of audiences.

These galleries hope to start a conversation about racism in medicine and highlight the injustice still faced by Black women and women of colour in gynaecological care. 

The Vagina Museum is just one of the many local organisations offering an opportunity to celebrate Black History Month and learn more about truthful narratives. 

Black History Month was originally started in the United States in 1976 by Carter G. Woodson. Inspired by Woodson’s commitment to challenging racism and elevating black voices, Akaaba Addai-Sebo, a Ghanaian activist, organised the first Black History Month in the UK held on October 1 1987.

The Windrush generation refers to the people who migrated from the Caribbean to London to help fix post-World War Two Britain in 1948. Many Jamaican women worked for the newly formed National Health Service at the time. It’s an important part of Black British history as in 2017 it emerged that hundreds of people in the Windrush generation had been denied legal rights, wrongly detained or even deported. 

London Museum Docklands invites you to hear the story of Ruby Hall who was one of the Jamaican nurses at the time of Windrush. In this talk learn about her experiences from when she moved to London at nineteen and the connection between the Windrush generation and our NHS.
