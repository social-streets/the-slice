Our guide to the best outdoor exercise classes near Roman Road offers you the perfect activity: a way to feel productive while enjoying the sun with friends.

The weather seems to be getting better (fingers crossed), and now that we can actually enjoy being outside again, there’s no excuse not to make the most of all of the beautiful green spaces we have on our doorstep, such as Victoria Park and Bethnal Green Gardens. Exercising outside is a great way to spend time with your besties—or maybe even make some new friends—while strengthening your body and clearing your head. 

Since the pandemic, we’ve seen our green spaces host many different types of fitness activities. Whether you’re into yoga, boxing, tennis or frisbee, there will be something for you. Both exercise and sunlight can make you feel infinitely better, so if you're feeling a bit down, try one of our suggested activities.

Angelika Grohmann has created Yoga Body of Light, a spiritual experience that also gives you a workout. Her specific practice is based on the precision and vigour of Iyengar Yoga but she personally focuses more on breathing and the body’s natural flow of movement. Her sessions are all-inclusive, regardless of fitness, strength or flexibility. Participants should expect non-competitive, easygoing, spacious, meditative and accessible sessions. Angelika has practised and taught yoga for more than 35 years. She believes that yoga ‘is the most challenging, most revealing path we can choose.’

Participants should expect fun workouts, led by friendly teachers, in a beautifully unique environment. You’ll be surrounded by incredible murals by world-famous street artist @zabou.
