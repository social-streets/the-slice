Anything goes at this gem of a theatre on the Isle of Dogs treasured by emerging writers and performers - and Sir Ian McKellen. 

The Space Theatre is halfway down Westferry Road on the Isle of Dogs, where you can feel the slight breeze from the River Thames. 

The former church, sitting snugly behind black iron railings, is noticeable for being the only Victorian building as far as the eye can see. A little picket fence separates an outdoor seating area under a pergola from a gravel and cobble courtyard to its right, and a wooden bench invites people to sit and ponder. 

If it weren’t for the fact that the hall is slap bang on the Isle of Dogs rattling ring road, engulfed by a hodge-podge of new builds, and in the cool shadows of Canary Wharf’s mountainous skyline, you’d think you were in a countryside village.

The building has two entrances leading to different parts of the venue accessed by narrow, steep stairways and stiff doors, adding to the charm of its age.

As you step through the narrow entrance into the dimly-lit, Victorian edifice, you are immediately transported to another world. Tall ceilings and the high arch over the stage draw the eyes upward in surprise. Wood-panelling muffles the sound magically.

As a Victorian-built church, the building has a past before the glitz and glam of theatre.

A pint-size theatre

Formerly St Paul’s Church, which closed in 1972 when its congregation of a hundred dwindled following the closure of the London Docks, St Paul Art Trust and The Space took over the building in 1996.

The Space puts on shows from different theatre companies but primarily from its own in-house participatory theatre group _SpaceWorks._ 

Performances range from classical theatre such as Shakespearean stories, to musical theatre, poetry, comedy shows and theatrical adaptations with an anything-goes attitude. 

The hall has a transformable space for various settings from the Shakespearean world to a wrestling ring and is complete with a viewing balcony.  Its physical adaptability allows it to have a quick turnover of shows. 

Unlike more traditional theatres, The Space runs performances for a matter of days rather than weeks or months. It’s recommended to book as soon as possible with some performances only being shown for one night. 

On the top floor, The Space Bar continues the cosy vibes serving drinks and food from a seasonal menu. It’s primarily a place for ‘afterparties’ allowing audience members and performers to connect, but it has also become a spot for locals to socialise. 

One of the company's latest features is its online streaming service, allowing those unable to secure tickets to enjoy performances from home. This initiative was inspired by their mission to make theatre as accessible as possible.

Despite the homeliness of this building, there’s an undercurrent of energy that gives The Space a real buzz.

For one night only

Programs at The Space are curated with a passion for supporting theatre artists rather than maximising profits, and feature performances that challenge societal stereotypes, break barriers, and amplify new voices. 

Previous shows have spotlighted immigrant experiences and gender discrimination. And with a ‘no-barriers’ approach, artists are encouraged to perform authentically and embrace the joy of expression.

Matthew Jameson, Interim Director said, ‘The Space is more than just a space, I hope it brings people a slice of life and an opportunity to see the rich seam of young and old local performers.’ 

Aside from performances, The Space has several workshops and theatre groups designed to support local talent including Script Space, Space Works and weekly sessions such as Friday Club Writes. 

Aspiring writers and performers can take on a variety of roles, both onstage and behind the scenes, allowing them to explore different opportunities in theatre production.

Hands-on workshops and participatory theatre projects give people the chance to receive feedback from industry professionals and to perform their work in front of a live audience. 

Mike Carter, the literary manager at The Space said ‘We are all about supporting the artists. We give people the opportunities to either perform, start a new show or watch a new show. 

‘For a lot of people it’s their first time being a part of a theatre company and people start from any age, not just young people.’ 

The writing workshop _Script Space_ nurtures emerging writers and focuses on developing writing that is unusual and offers new perspectives. 

‘Script Space guarantees new writers to have their scripts read and with guaranteed feedback. The point isn’t to necessarily produce that play, the point is to support the talent and as many talents as possible.’ said Carter.

A knighted patron

It’s no surprise that this little gem is treasured by local resident Sir Ian McKellen, who has supported The Space since it opened in 1996.

[McKellen, who donated £40,000 to support independent theatres during the pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/18/ian-mckellen-donates-40000-to-help-uk-theatre-workers-through-pandemic), has even chosen the venue for his own productions, including _A Knight Out_ in The Space's opening year following his knighthood by the Queen in 1991, and _Ian McKellen On Stage,_ the tour that celebrated his 80th birthday, in 2019. 

The Space currently receives no regular funding, relying on donations and fundraisers to fund everything from the productions to the maintenance of the building itself. 

The "Space Decon Crowd Funder" campaign, launched in October 2024 to raise £20,000, aims to support daytime events, workshops, new playwrights, expanded new writing development, and broader access to live streams. 

Past fundraisers have successfully raised £33,000 to install a lift, making the bar accessible to people with disabilities.

‘We are nothing without our community. We are nothing without our supporters,’ expressed Jameson who has been Interim Director since June 2024.

For Carter, The Space has become his second home, a sentiment shared by others who have performed and been a part of the charity. 

Steven Shawcroft has been involved with The Space since 2012 with various roles from actor, researcher, technical operator, stand-up comedian and more. 

‘The amount of people who have discovered The Space by accident and have stuck around, I’m sure they must have felt a similar way to me

‘I really appreciate the fact that I can always come here just to escape the world for a bit, I always know I can just pop in and have a chat and everything will be right again.’ 

The Space stands beside the towering businesses of Canary Wharf as an artistic and community haven. It offers viewers what is rare in larger, mainstream theatres – innovative performances and raw, emerging talent. 

Once abandoned due to the area’s decline, the space has returned to its original purpose of serving the community. If it were to disappear, it would leave a fearful gap, not only in the theatre world but also the Island’s community.
