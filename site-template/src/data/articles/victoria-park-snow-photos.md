Dusting the pagoda, freezing East Lake and accentuating Coutt's fountain, the piercing cold has brought a flurry of snow covering Vicky Park in a blanket of white. Our local photographers capture its festive beauty.

These photos of [Victoria Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/) covered in snow will help to banish any blues you might have this winter. Picturesque [all year round](https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-autumn-photoessay/), this green space on our doorstep has been transformed into an ethereal world dusted with snowflakes.

It has been bitingly cold this past week, with the Met Office issuing a level three [cold weather alert](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/cold-weather-alert/?tab=coldWeatherAlert&season=normal) on Friday. But those chilly toes and foggy windshields are made slightly more bearable when the snowflakes start falling, particularly when you have Vicky Park on your doorstep. 

If you usually go through the park on your morning commute, be sure to stroll past the frozen lake, glittering in the early morning light. The wide pathways cutting through the park are turned into snowy tundras, sealed with the footprints of excited children (and adults too).  

The Chinese Pagoda, modelled as it was on the 1841 version built by [James Pennethorne](https://romanroadlondon.com/james-pennethorne-victoria-park-landscape-architect/), is dusted with snow that accentuates the oriental design. Originally designed as a summer house, we think it looks as pretty as a gingerbread house in this weather. 

The Coutt’s drinking fountain clad in white is straight from a Dickens novel, evoking visions of winter’s past. The gothic architecture attracts photographers and filmmakers year round and you’ll spot this as the backdrop for several [grime music](https://romanroadlondon.com/rhythm-division-grime-record-shop-bow/) videos.

Running along the park’s edge is the [Regent’s Canal](https://romanroadlondon.com/history-regents-canal-200-year-anniversary/) where the barges float silently on the water like glaciers in icy oceans. With night-time temperatures dropping below freezing every night this week, we hope our local [boaties](https://romanroadlondon.com/regents-canal-boat-window-photos-rose-palmer/) are keeping warm. 

Here is a collection of shots by our local photographers this year and in previous years out in droves capturing the mystical beauty of Victoria Park, transformed by an artic makeover this December.
