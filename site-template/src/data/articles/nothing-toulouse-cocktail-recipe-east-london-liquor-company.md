East London Liquor Company is a very special place. Why? Because why you’re sipping on ice-cold cocktails made by the in-house mixologists, new batches of gin and whiskey are being distilled under the same roof.

Nothing Toulouse is a twist on the classic cocktail ‘Arsenic and Old Lace’ (named after the famous American dark comedy movie from 1944). The Violette highlights the lavender in their premium Batch No. 2 gin. Perfect for a boozy but light martini-style serve.

#### Ingredients:

- 35ml ELLC Batch No. 2 Gin
- 15ml Lillet Blanc
- 7.5ml Creme de Violette (We used Briottet)
- 2 drops Absinthe

In a straight-sided glass or cocktail mixing glass, combine all ingredients together.

Stir with ice, about 20 turns of a spoon should be perfect.

Strain into a cocktail glass and garnish with a flower of your choice, serve on a lace doily.
