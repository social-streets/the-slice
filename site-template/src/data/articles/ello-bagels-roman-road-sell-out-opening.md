Finally, beigels are back on the menu on Roman Road and taste all the better for being served by twin brothers Sergen and Sencer and lifelong friend PJ who went to Bow’s Old Ford Primary School

Sergen and Sencer Aytug and ParamJeet Sing (PJ) have opened Ello Bagels on Roman Road, a new beigel shop selling gourmet-style beigels, pastries and specialist coffees. 

The shop opened on Saturday and completely sold out of all fillings due to its popularity.

The beigel shop has a sage green exterior and a warm aesthetically pleasing white interior complete with a small seating area with four stools and large fake plants.

Everything is Ello Bagel branded from the uniform, to the beigel packaging and a pink ‘Ello Bagel’ neon sign on the wall giving the shop an Instagram-worthy look.  

It is located at 455 Roman Road, six doors down from [Jungle Electric](https://romanroadlondon.com/places/jungle-electric/) and opposite [Cafe East](https://romanroadlondon.com/cafe-east-roman-road-mustafa-has-interview/). 

The business is owned by twins Sencer and Sergen Aytug and lifelong friend PJ who grew up together in Bow and attended Old Ford Primary School. 

The three owners still live in Bow and have been serving old-school friends, reminiscing on their childhoods.

The Aytug brothers previously had different careers in banking and PJ used to be an electrician but united together to bring something to Roman Road they believed was missing. 

Sencer said, ‘We thought it was a good idea to set up a trendy, grab-and-go new food option on Roman Road. 

‘We wanted to be different to other popular beigel shops, with a more gourmet style where we cook on-site and offer filings that other beigel shops don't like our BBQ beef brisket which has already become a favourite with customers.’

The beigel fillings are prepared in front of customers giving the shop a flavourful and crisp aroma.

The menu is divided into two sections: Classics and Specials. Classic options include well-known choices including smoked salmon cream cheese, tuna mayo, and of course salt beef. 

The Specials feature more adventurous choices including BBQ beef brisket, Sujuk and Kashar cheese, and spicy red hummus. We’re sure ‘The Chopped Cheese’ – a chopped beef burger sauteed with onion, American cheese, chilli jam, lettuce and tomato – will become a favourite. 

Sweet beigels are also on the menu, including options such as blueberry cream cheese or peanut butter. 

The prices for beigels range from £6 to £8.95 and the shop plans to be open from 7 am - 6 pm 7 days a week. 

‘We opened on Saturday and it was hectic, we completely sold out of all fillings. We planned to open on Sunday but had to restock everything instead, it went much better than expected’ said Sencer.

Ello Bagel also sells pastries such as stuffed doughnuts and cupcakes, including vegan and gluten-free options, and plans are currently in the making for vegan cream cheese to be added to the menu. 

Wait times have been long as the owners are still finding their feet but due to the local appetite for proper East End beigels, the queues aren’t expected to drop.
