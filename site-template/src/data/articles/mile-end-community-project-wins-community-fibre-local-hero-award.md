Recognised for its work bridging the digital divide in Tower Hamlets, the Mile End-based initiative will receive a lifetime of free full fibre broadband connection

Mile End Community Project has won the Community Fibre broadband provider’s first-ever annual Local Hero Award, recognising its work with young people in Tower Hamlets.

Launched by local volunteers in 1995, the Mile End-based initiative runs community projects for local young people providing creative opportunities to engage in civic life, focusing on the digital and film industry. 

In March, Mile End Community Project teamed up with Tower Hamlets Council to put on Cutting East Film Festival, celebrating the work of young filmmakers and creatives across the borough. 

Presented by Community Fibre’s Chief Digital Officer Theo Blackwell and CEO Graeme Oxby on Thursday 11 May, the award includes a free 100% full fibre broadband connection.

This will make Mile End Community Project Community Fibre’s 500th freely connected community space across the capital. 

Nurull Islam, Mile End Community Project Co-founder said: ‘As an organisation that works heavily with film and media it will help us massively when transferring large files. In the past, we’ve had to leave films to upload for 9-10 hours but with Community Fibre we have done it in 20 minutes.

‘They have offered us a lifetime of free broadband connection which is amazing, especially at a time like now.’ 

Blackwell said: ‘Mile End Community Project has done incredible work supporting people of all ages to get online. 

‘We are so grateful for Nurull and all the team's dedication and commitment to Mile End, where they have made a significant impact in bridging the digital divide and empowering the community with essential digital skills.’

In celebration of the award, Community Fibre is hosting a pop-up fair at Mile End Community Project today (Thursday 11 May) from midday until 6 pm, including a digital drop-in clinic for anyone wanting to brush up on their digital skills.
