‘The market is my life’: Petticoat Lane Food Court traders respond to winning the award for the Best Speciality Market of 2024.

Petticoat Lane Food Court in Spitalfields has been crowned the Best Small Speciality Market at the Great British Market Awards of 2024.

The National Association of British Market Authorities (NABMA), who host the awards every year, praised the food court for its ‘vibrant atmosphere, support for emerging talents, and innovative approaches to community engagement’.

The food court was set up in 2009 by Tower Hamlets Council, to encourage more visitors to the [historic Petticoat Lane area.](https://whitechapellondon.co.uk/petticoat-lane-market-history/) Starting with a modest budget and only three traders, the food court has grown over the years into a vibrant hub of East End activity, attracting hundreds of people five days a week.

Today, 20 vendors populate Goulston Street, Bell Lane & Wentworth Street, serving cuisine from all over the globe, from katsu wraps and seafood paella to chicken satay curry. The food court has continued the street market heritage of Petticoat Lane which dates back to the 17th century.

Shaker Al-Bdour from Eye Falafel has been serving Londoners traditional Jordanian wraps since the food court first opened and welcomes up to 400 customers per day. He said:

‘We were ecstatic to see that Petticoat Lane had been announced the winner, for many people including myself, our lives revolve around creating a joyful experience to those that visit the market, whether they are regulars or first time customers.

‘The experience has been one that we will forever be thankful for, seeing the market grow from what it was to what it is now is tremendous and being part of it is what makes it special. 

The market is my life and it truly adds a meaning to the phrase, “do what you love”. We love our customers and feel joy when we provide a service they trust and enjoy.’

Pattaraporn Boochan has been serving customers authentic Thai cuisine from his stall Satay Street for 12 years. She said:

‘I’m very glad to win the award and very appreciative to the \[Tower Hamlets\] Markets Team for making this happen. Everyone is friendly here and we are like neighbours to each other.

‘All the food we make is fresh and on show for everyone to see. Food comes from love you know, and we want to give our customers the best. It’s a good vibe!’
