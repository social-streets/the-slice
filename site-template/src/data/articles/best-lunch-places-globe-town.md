You’ve probably walked past this little corner gem many times, unaware of the selection of wraps and toasties that are freshly made inside. With the winning fillings of roast chicken or grilled halloumi, their list of lunch options is worth checking out. If you choose to sit in, try their mouthwatering pan of Shakshuka.

![Tanakrit and Supap Pimpa, owners of Mum Likes Thai Food, Thai restaurant on Roman Road in Globe Town, East London.](/images/Mum-Likes-Thai-Food-Roman-Road-Globe-Town-1024x683.jpg)

Opened by chef Tanakrit Pimpa and his wife, Supap, who manages the front of house, be prepared for warm welcome smiles and friendly chitchat. Lunch is a set menu but the portions are generous. Opt for a traditional Green Thai Curry, or their sell-out Pad Thai, with a choice of chicken, beef, prawn or tofu. All dishes are as close to the original recipe as would be found in the Pimpa’s home in Thailand. Open every day for lunch from 12-3 p.m.
