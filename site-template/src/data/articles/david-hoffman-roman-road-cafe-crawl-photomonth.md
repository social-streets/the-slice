The Cafe Crawl (part of Photomonth) on Roman Road is showing rarely seen photos from renown local photojournalist [David Hoffman](https://www.hoffmanphotos.com/ "David Hoffman website"). His photography has ranged from racism to riots but also pictures of the East End since the early '70s. Few of them have been seen before and the Roman Road Cafe Crawl for [Photomonth](https://2014.photomonth.org/ "Photomonth website") is a rare opportunity to see this moving documentation of East End life.

The photos are being displayed at Roman Rd Art Café, Zealand Road Coffee Shop and Vinarius. "The photographs are of the ordinary, wonderful people who lived in this part of London" says Hoffman, "and so it seems fitting to show them where today's ordinary, wonderful people eat, drink and relax."

On the evening of Thursday 16th October there will be a Private View at a fourth coffee shop, Muxima, to launch the final group of photographs to be hung as part of the Roman Road Cafe Crawl. These will  contain Hoffman's more political work documenting protests and riots.

On Saturday October 18th at about noon Hoffman will be available at Roman Rd Art Cafe to talk about the photographs and lead a relaxed tour around all four cafes.

_David Hoffman's Roman Road Cafe Crawl exhibition runs until the end of November 2014._
