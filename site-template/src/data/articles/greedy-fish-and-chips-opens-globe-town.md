A new chippy has come to 150 Roman Road. Greedy Fish and Chips is now up and running opposite [Peckover Butchers](https://romanroadlondon.com/peckover-butchers-roman-road-interview/) in Globe Town.

All the fish and chip staples are on the menu, including cod, hake, haddock, rock, and skate. The fish is skinless and prepared using groundnut oil and special halloumi butter. A selection of sausages, pies, burgers, and roast chicken dishes are also available.

The shop is run by Simon Sheen and Ali Yukselir. Sheen designed the interior, while Yukselir brings nearly 30 years experience running fish and chip shops in East London, having previously owned one in Bethnal Green since the early 1990s.

'You need to update yourself,' Yukselir said. 'Your shop, your food, everything. Customers know me from when I was in Bethnal Green. We are already busy and I know it will get better with time.'

Speaking of his decision to set up a new venture in Globe Town, he said: 'The area is improving. We wanted to be a part of that.'

Opening times for the shop are currently 11.30am to 10pm seven days a week, and Yukselir is open to extending those hours if the demand is there. You can eat in or take away.

_You can visit Greedy Fish & Chips at 150 Roman Road, E2 0RY_
