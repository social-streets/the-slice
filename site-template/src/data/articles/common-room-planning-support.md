Roman Road Trust has successfully hit their Crowdfunding target to revive The Common Room, a derelict community high street space at 503 Roman Road. With help from the local community and recently, a pledge of £10,000 by Tower Hamlets Council, Roman Road Trust has not only raised original target but are looking to surpass it. But the fight is not yet over.

Roman Road Trust has submitted their planning application to transform the Common Room, and they need your support to make it a reality. The council will take statements of oppositions or support from community members when considering planning applications, so every statement towards the Common Room will count. [Visit their website](https://romanroadtrust.co.uk/transform-the-common-room-support-planning-application/) for more information on how you can help. 

The community has answered the calls of Roman Road Trust, coming together to help raise their target of £77,000, with help from the council and the Mayor of London - who pledged the highest possible amount of £50,000. This would not have been possible without the help of the local community members who also pledged their support for The Common Room.

The funds raised will go towards reviving the Common Room, currently a derelict, semi-outdoor structure on Ford Road, which will be expanded and rebuilt into a family-friendly learning space for local people.
