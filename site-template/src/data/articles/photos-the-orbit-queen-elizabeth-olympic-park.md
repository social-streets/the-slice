Bow local Phil Verney shares a selection of his photographs of the Orbit and Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford.

From his apartment just off Roman Road, local resident Phil Verney has a great vantage point of Anish Kapoor's Orbit and Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and a great eye for capturing the neighbourhood at its best.

His wonderful photos may make you think he is a pro, but photography is just a hobby for [Verney](https://www.instagram.com/philverney/). 'I've always been interested in photography, but like any hobby, it's a journey of learning' he says.

Shooting the local area interests him not only because it's where he lives (and has for the past few years), but he loves the redevelopment coming out of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

He explains, 'Many of the newer buildings offer interesting perspectives and the way the light interacts with them makes for some great photographs.'

For those budding photographers among you, Verney shoots all his photos on either a Nikon D7000 or D7500.
