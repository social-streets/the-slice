Coming in at a very close second, Zealand Café is loved by locals and visitors alike, and there’s rarely a moment in the day that it’s not overflowing with customers. Hard wooden tables, grey brick walls, geometric paintings and loads of natural light make it one of the most Instagrammable spots on the Roman. But Zealand is not only good for your social media feed. Its friendly baristas give this café its infectious buzz, and they’ll sort you out with one of the best coffees around town.

Opening in January this year, [Coffee and Fripes](https://romanroadlondon.com/coffee-fripes-cafe-open/) introduced a taste of France to the East End, serving French patisseries, sandwiches and cakes good enough to transport you to the continent. We hear the raspberry tartlets are particularly tasty.

This cosy cafe at the Bethnal Green end of the Roman Road has Italian style written all over it. Quarantacinque serves only Caffé Molinari, from an espresso alla Romana to a proper flat white, these guys take their coffee seriously.
