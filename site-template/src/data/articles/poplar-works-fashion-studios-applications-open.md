Applications are now open for more than 40 studios in [Poplar Works](https://poplarworks.co.uk/studios/), a workspace project designed to support a new era of fashion in East London.

The studios have been developed in partnership between Poplar HARCA, London College of Fashion, UAL, and the Trampery. It is part of the [Fashion District](https://www.fashion-district.co.uk/) initiative, which aims to nurture a new generation of fashion talent in East London. 

Studios range from 114 to 298 square feet and start at £200 a month. Smaller spaces can fit one or two people, while larger spaces can house as many as six.  The first round of applications closes on 18 November.

The studios at Poplar Works are open to anyone working in the fashion economy – designers, makers, photographers, jewellers, and more - although the programme is particularly keen to see applications from early stage businesses, and anyone based East London.

Those interested in applying can find more details about the process and the available studio types at [https://poplarworks.co.uk/studios/](https://poplarworks.co.uk/studios/)
