Known for its eclectic mix of local heritage and the avant-garde, east London’s art galleries explore everything from East End revolutions, occult art and island hopping this autumn.

Now that the trees in Vicky Park are shivering, there’s no better time to get inside and look at some art. This autumn local galleries across east London are showing everything from archival photography of the East End to modern sculpture and never-before-displayed ‘magickal’ art.

We've selected some of the best exhibitions with long runs into Christmas and the New Year. But many smaller venues are putting on exhibitions with shorter runs that are well worth seeking out. Check out Poplar Union on Bartlett Park, Gallery Cafe on Old Ford Road, The Yurt in Limehouse, and the Brady Centre in Whitechapel, all of which have a roster of fascinating, community-driven exhibitions.

Read on to find out our top recommendations for exhibitions you can catch throughout autumn and into winter and the New Year.

Bow photojournalist David Hoffman has spent more than 40 years photographing the streets of London and the East End, with a focus on protest and oppression. Famously he photographed the Brixton riots as well as the protests following the murder of Altab Ali. ‘Endurance & Joy in the East End’ pays homage to Hoffman’s impressive body of work. 

This exhibit is a special one as it was curated by Spitalfield’s well-loved anonymous scribe, The Gentle Author. Hoffman and the Gentle Author successfully crowd-funded just under £11,000 to put this exhibit on at the Museum of the Home in Hoxton.

The [East London Group](https://romanroadlondon.com/east-london-group-artists-bow/) were a mostly working-class artists group who painted east London in the late 1920s and early 1930s. They painted realist depictions of the streets of East London, creating a time capsule. 

For this exhibit by Bow Arts, twenty-two modern artists were invited to trace the footsteps of the East London Group. They’ve made new work that responds both to the echoes of the past and the group’s original ethos. The exhibit will show work from the original East London Group and the modern cohort.

‘Romance in the Mundane,’ is a collection of love letters to Cantopop – a pop genre sung in Cantonese. Cantopop was at its height in the 70s and 80s and is especially associated with (and beloved by) those from Hong Kong. 

The exhibition features love letters to Cantopop music sandwiched into the tops of the cafe tables, with English translations. There are also archival materials on the Cantopop era’s cultural significance to peruse and, of course, the music itself. Please note – because the exhibit is spread throughout the cafe tables, it’s a coin toss which letters you will see.  

‘Romance in the Mundane’ is being hosted by HOKO, a Hong Kong cafe on Brick Lane. You need to buy something at the cafe to see this exhibit, but each visitor will get a free ‘baseball card’ of a Cantopop icon. Plus, the combination of nostalgia and HOKO’s signature silky traditional milk tea is truly sweet.

_Find HOKO cafe at 224 Brick Ln, London E1 6SA. For more information visit HOKO’s Instagram @hoko.london_

The interactive exhibition will feature unseen archive material, new short films, and stories from the East End. [It’s running until the 15th of October, 2024 at Oxford House in Bethnal Green.](https://romanroadlondon.com/events/exhibition-history-house-140-oxford-house/)

An archipelago is a cluster of distinct but connected islands, used for this exhibition as a concept with which to link a wide diversity of perspectives and artistic practices. 

The artists showing in ‘Archipelago’ are from across the globe and their mediums include photography, paint, and sculpture. At first glance the works are completely different, but the exhibition is delicately connected with a common ‘archipelagic’ thread.  

‘Archipelago’ is showing at Whitechapel Gallery until January 2025 and entry is free.
