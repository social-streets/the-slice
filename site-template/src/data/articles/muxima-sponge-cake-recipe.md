Muxima is a serious crowd pleaser on Roman Road, famous for its friendly faces, great music but most of all, its cake. The cooks at [Muxima](https://romanroadlondon.com/best-brunch-bow-mile-end-globe-town/) are handing over their recipe for a rhubarb and elderflower sponge cake, perfect for summer parties.

#### Ingredients

50ml elderflower cordial 12" piece of rhubarb, cut in chunks 250g butter 215g caster sugar 3 eggs 50ml yoghurt 250g self raising flour Lemon zest

#### Preparation

If you can still find some elderflower in the hedgerow (the season is coming to an end in London) make a syrup with 8 of the flowers, 200g of sugar and 100ml of water. If not, just use the cordial from shops.

The rhubarb, however, is still going strong. We get ours from our regular Tom who lives the other side of Roman Road.

First, stew the rhubarb in a pan with two shots of your elderflower and the zest of a lemon. Cook for 10 minutes at a low heat.

Beat together the butter, sugar and eggs. Mixture should look light and creamy. I use a hand wish at the cafe, but you can use an electric one to save time.

Fold in the rhubarb mixture, yoghurt and flour. Line and grease a cake tin of your choice and fill with the mixture. Knock down the tray on the surface and bake at 180°C for 35-40 minutes.

Best served with dark chocolate sauce and a flat white.
