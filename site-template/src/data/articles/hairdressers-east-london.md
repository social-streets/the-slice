The East End is home to all sorts of different people, and the hairdressing salons in the area reflect that; from a speedy and cheap cut to a luxurious ombre and Brazilian blow-dry, there's a salon for everyone.

But price and convenience aren't the only factor in getting a good hair experience. The salons around Roman Road are often favoured by customers not just because of their snipping skills, but because the stylists offer them something else, whether it's friendship, football, or just a no-fuss cut perfected over 60 years.

It can take a lot of trial and error to settle on a salon that's right for you, so our roundup of hair salons around Roman Road can skip a step and serve as a guide if you're looking for a new spot to treat your tresses.

## Reids, Roman Road

![Interior of Reids hairdresser on Roman Road, Bow](/images/hairdressers-bow-globe-town-reids-1024x683.jpg)

A veteran local salon, Reids used to share Roman Road with Randolfi's, [Percy Ingle](https://romanroadlondon.com/percy-ingle-bakery-east-london/) and [Herbert’s](https://romanroadlondon.com/herberts-fruit-and-salad-globe-town/), but you couldn't tell its impressive age now with the facelift the current Panayiotou family have given it: the salon looks as new and fresh as ever. Its loyal customers remember the family from generations back, but keep returning for their stylists who keep up with the latest trends and products. One of our readers, Craig Richards, has been going to Reids for almost 20 years. ‘It’s a great family run business that has been on the Roman since the late ’70s,’ he says.

Run by Cypriot husband and wife team Ossie and Jan, Ossie's promises consistent quality and offers a comprehensive range of styles, but it's a firm community favourite because of their connections with their customers. If you want a no-fuss haircut skilfully undertaken with a personal touch and a good laugh with the regulars, Ossie's is your spot. Ossie has had to move venue a few times to counter increases in rent, but we’re happy to say he’s still here.

## Lux Studio, Roman Road

![Interior of Lux Studio on Roman Road, Bow](/images/hairdressers-bow-globe-town-lux-studio-2-1024x683.jpg)

Though this salon does almost anything beauty-related you could think of, its cuts and colours are something people keep coming back for even from beyond the area. Manager Rita's aim is to give people a service from any stylist at work there that is the best they can possibly do, and it shows. She and her staff are highly skilled in hair colouring, from selecting precise tones for each hair type to impacting the minimum level of damage. The result? High end for low prices. Be sure to stop by on Halloween, because the staff go all out on their spooky makeup. Have you ever seen zombies cutting hair? You can at Lux.

Run by Wendy and Michelle, Rembrants is an unpretentious and welcoming salon that offers consistent cutting quality for its secure base of customers. But it's not just cheap and cheerful haircuts the locals keep coming back for; Wendy and Michelle are both big football fans, and often show matches inside the salon. They're West Ham fans, but other fans enjoy their company too, even if just for some lively footy debate during a trim.

## Idol Hair, Victoria Park Road

![Interior of Idol Hair, Victoria Park Road](/images/hairdressers-bow-globe-town-idol-hair-1024x683.jpg)

This salon is a local favourite for its tight-knit familial staff as well as its ability to accomplish any look under the sun. On a busy Saturday you’ll see people of all ages getting anything from a simple blow-dry to a fluorescent pink balayage, but the community vibe keeps people coming back. ‘Going in is like dropping in on a neighbour for an impromptu party,’ says reader Rachel Richardson. Unlike others in the area, Idol has visiting stylists, so if you have a favourite from Instagram they might pop by here. Plus, the salon is doing its best to be environmentally friendly; they now offer customers refills on shampoo and conditioners. Just bring in your empty bottle and they’ll fill it up, plastic-free.

## New Image, Old Ford Road

![Managers of New Image hairdressing salon on Old Ford Road](/images/hairdressers-bow-globe-town-new-image-1024x683.jpg)

New Image has been around Old Ford for 34 years, and the group of smiling cousins who run it have seen some of their customers for all that time. They remember some who came in for cuts when they were children, and are now adults bringing their own children of the same age. The customers keep coming back over the decades for the reasonable prices and stylists with years of experience, but also for a good chin-wag. Plus, they're one of the few salons left that still have roller sets, and discounted pensioner days on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to accompany them.

## Creations, Roman Road

![Owner standing inside Creations hairdressing salon, Roman Road, Bow](/images/hairdressers-bow-globe-town-creations-1024x683.jpg)

Situated right on Roman Road Market and only open on market days, Creations has an ornate shopfront which lures visitors inside the tiny (and equally cute) interior. The brick walls and a glamorous chandelier is not what you would expect of such a modest place, but it all adds up to a warm neighbourhood vibe. Owner Adi has come from Brazil to bring people the best in authentic damage-preventing Brazilian blow-dries, but also likes his clientele to become friends rather than just customers. Most of the decorations and furniture is up-cycled; the mirrors all come from old wardrobes and plants have been picked up from the street.

## The Canary, Old Bethnal Green Road

![Cactuses in the inside of The Canary hairdressing salon in Bethnal Green](/images/hairdressers-bow-globe-town-canary-1-1024x683.jpg)

The hippest hairdressing salon on our list, The Canary nests on a spot that used to be a halal butcher. Now it's a modern salon offering nail and eyelash as well as hair beautification, and even more prominent than co-owner Vix's overflowing cactus collection is its ongoing aim is to be as eco-friendly as possible. Their products are all vegan and low-energy consumption, and they are moving into a plastic-free era, using glass and experimenting with sugar cane 'plastic'. They also feature changing local art in the salon and the adjoined vegan cafe, so you can snazz up your hair while taking in the local culture and sipping an almond latte.

## Spencer Hair, Roman Road

![Outside of Spencer Hairdresser for Afro-Carribean hair on Roman Road](/images/hairdressers-bow-globe-town-spencer-1024x683.jpg)

Janet Spencer offers the only Afro-Caribbean hair services in the local area, so she's rightfully become a favourite of much of the local community. She's been on Roman Road for 20 years, but may soon have to leave the area because of rising rent. Many of her loyal customers will miss her friendly touch and lifetime of experience with black hair, so we hope to see her stick around and keep telling us stories in the years to come.

## Hair 359, Roman Road

![Child getting haircut inside of Hair 359 hairdressing salon on Roman Road](/images/hairdressers-bow-globe-town-hair-359-1024x683.jpg)

A 7-year-old salon, Hair 359 is one of the younger hairdressers of the area. But the salon spawned from a much longer-established one in the area; Russo's had been around for 40 years when Mr Russo decided to retire, but one of his managers, Barry, continued the dream and opened Hair 359. Sadly, Barry passed away last year, but his legacy lives on in his dedicated and caring staff, not to mention his dog and salon mascot Ralph. New customers and those coming from Russo's keep coming back to Hair 359 for the family atmosphere and Danielle's quality haircuts. Even Mr Russo comes out of retirement occasionally to cut hair at the salon.

Her aim is to bring the West End quality she's mastered into the East End, and the people who travel from further than the East for her salon will vouch for her skills and quality products.
