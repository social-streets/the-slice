Upstarter, a design-led incubator for future micro-businesses, is coming to Roman Road Yard Market this weekend to showcase four rising stars of the design world.

Upstarter works with designers, makers and creative entrepreneurs to help them take their ideas to market, in this case Roman Road Yard Market to trial the product.  They work with incubators, studios and co-working spaces to support new and fragile early business ideas and help them develop roots and grow stronger.

At the heart of this is our method of de-risking new ventures through design-led techniques and rapid prototyping. 

'The four new businesses we have this Saturday come out of our evening class Six Weeks to Pop Up,' says founder Gill Wildman. 'They have brilliant new ideas that they want to test out on the wonderful people at Roman Road Yard Market.'

The four designers being featured at Roman Road Yard Market this Saturday 9 April are Badass Brides, Ply Set, Fix IT and Mix It Up. Please come down to support the start-ups and to spot the rising stars of tomorrow's design world.
