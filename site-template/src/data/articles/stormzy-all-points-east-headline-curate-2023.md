The rapper will take over Victoria Park for ‘This Is What We Mean Day’, curating a lineup of artists before performing his own headline set.

Stormzy will headline and curate a whole day of music at All Points East festival 2023 in Victoria Park called This Is What We Mean Day. 

The day is named after Stormzy’s third album, ‘This Is What I Mean’, which is due to be released on Friday 25 November. 

Featuring the rapper’s favourite artists, from up-and-comers to superstars, This Is What We Mean Day is the first of its kind seen at the popular East London music festival, which first took place in [Victoria Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/) in 2018. 

Stormzy’s performance in East London will be his only UK show in 2023, the lineup for which will be announced in celebration of his latest album which was inspired by a Stormzy music camp of producers and musicians in Osea Island in Essex.  

In his announcement video posted on social media, Stormzy said: ‘I was thinking what’s next, cos we’ve done three O2s, shut that down. I said to the team, we gotta do something bigger, something better, something different.

‘Then it hit me … live band, need a live band. August 2023, a summer time thing, outside, for the people, always for my people. So August 2023, Victoria Park, more info coming soon….This Is What We Mean Day. Hard.’ 

In collaboration with Tower Hamlets Council, All Points East will also be running their annual ‘In The Neighbourhood,’ a programme of free events and activities for the local community alongside the music festival. 

Previous activities have included yoga sessions, street food, open air movie nights and film panels with Rich Mix. Local businesses should keep an eye on the All Points East website for information about signing up, and the schedule will be announced in the new year.
