### There's no shortage of great pubs in Bethnal Green. If you’re looking for a great Bethnal boozer, look no further than this list of pubs.

There's no shortage of places to go for a drink in Bethnal Green, whether it's a cocktail bar you're after such as Satan's Whiskers or a brewery like Mother Kelly's. In this list, we're sticking to traditional pubs in Bethnal Green.

## The Salmon and Ball

This is possibly one of the first pubs in Bethnal Green you'll see when you hope off the tube. Getting off at the station,you’ll arrive almost straight in front of the doors of this pub. The Salmon and Ball is certainly a traditional East End boozer, with the pub claiming history way back to 1733. 

## The Shakespeare

“Is this a dagger which I see before me?” asked William Shakespeare’s titular character in the play Hamlet. Well, in this pub named after the playwright you might find yourself not believing what you see before your eyes. It’s hard to believe that this pub boasts pints for as little as £2.70. This affordable, local pub has a distinctive exterior, with Truman’s green tiling adorning the front of the building. 

## The Sun Tavern

If you’re in the mood for a pub that has offerings beyond the traditional pint in Bethnal Green, then The Sun Tavern is the place to go. This pub is known for its excellent cocktails and whiskey selection. The clientele consists mostly of young people prone to wearing flares and dungarees

## The Bethnal Green Tavern

Another pub on Bethnal Green Road, this place used to be a Wetherspoons before changing hands. These days, it’s more craft beers than ‘Spoons pitchers. If you’re keen for a bite to eat the pub also offers fresh food, as well as a beer garden. 

## The Old George

We’re thinking of doing a pub crawl down Bethnal Green Road as its full of pubs. The Old George is also on Bethnal Green road. It’s another one for those seeking out pub grub, with their Sunday lunches proving particularly popular. 

## The Marquis of Cornwallis

And it's another pub on Bethnal Green Road! The Marquis of Cornwallis is a local haunt. It offers sport on the telly, and pool and darts in the pub itself.

## The Star of Bethnal Green

Yet another pub on Bethnal Green Road. The Star of Bethnal Green states on its website that it is “anything but a traditional East End boozer”. It is known for its events, from live music, to karaoke to DJ nights.

## King’s Arms

Finally, we’re listing a pub not on Bethnal Green Road. The King’s Arms lies on Buckfast Street (we’re unsure if they stock the tonic wine). The pub is focused on its craft beers, and has award-winning cask ales. 

## Carpenter’s Arms

This Cheshire Street pub may be infamous as a hangout of the Krays, but today it is better known for a criminally good pint there. Small and cozy, the pub hosts patrons of all ages, with blokes in flat caps happily sitting and sipping alongside the vintage shoppers who have wandered off Brick Lane. 

## Dundee Arms

The Dundee Arms’ Twitter bio proclaims it was “formerly known as the worst pub in Bethnal Green”. That’s an accolade that the current owners of this Cambridge Heath Road pub have proudly lost. The pub has unassuming decor and wide selection of beers. It’s a particularly good spot for catching a game of football.
