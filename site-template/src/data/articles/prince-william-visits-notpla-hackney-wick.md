Having won the Prince’s environmental awards last year, his visit included a tour around the sustainable packaging startup, viewing its new prototype of sustainable takeaway boxes.

The Prince of Wales visited Notpla sustainable packaging startup in Hackney Wick this morning (Tuesday 23 May), checking in on one of last year's winners of his Earthshot Prize Awards. 

Prince William, 40, made the visit to see how the Eartthshot platform has helped Notpla expand its team and invest in machinery for research and development. 

Located just across Queen’s Yard from Silo, the world’s [first zero-waste restaurant](https://romanroadlondon.com/silo-zero-waste-hackney-wick-restaurant-review/), Notpla won the Build a Waste-Free World category at the Earthshot environmental awards in November 2022. 

The [Hackney Wick](https://romanroadlondon.com/hackney-wick-bars-restaurants-raves/) startup develops seaweed and plant-based alternatives to single-use plastic packaging in order to reduce landfill and ocean waste. 

To date, it has replaced nearly three million units of single-use plastic from disposable cutlery to luxury packaging boxes. 

Prince William had a tour of Notpla’s headquarters and viewed a prototype of sustainable takeaway boxes branded with the Earthshot Prize logo, which will go into production next month. 

Prince William launched the Earthshot Prize in 2020 to promote the development of effective solutions to the climate crisis. 

Winners of the prize receive one million pounds to support their initiatives, which focus on repairing and reviving the natural environment. 

The inaugural awards ceremony was held in London in October 2021 with plans for the prizes to continue until 2030.
