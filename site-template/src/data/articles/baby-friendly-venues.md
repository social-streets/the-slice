After having a baby, all of a sudden your priorities for where to spend a few hours change significantly. Not only do you need somewhere to enjoy a glass of wine, but you need enough space for a few prams, decent changing facilities and no side glances when your baby kicks up a fuss. Don't worry though, Roman Road has plenty, and new mother and local resident Tara Hounslea has compiled the ultimate list just for you.

## IDEA Store Bow

The IDEA Store in Bow holds a free story time every day from Monday to Saturday for babies and kids up to 5 at 10.30am. On Saturday, there is also a Dads’ Club on Saturdays at 11.15am.

## Meath Gardens Children's Centre

[Meath Gardens](https://romanroadlondon.com/friends-meath-gardens-mile-end/) Children's Centre is the closest to Roman Road but there’s a whole network nearby that offer a comprehensive programme of activities for children, parents and carers, including baby massage courses. If you go too early, the whole thing might seem a bit strange – particularly if your baby falls asleep through a whole session like mine did and you just end up sat singing nursery rhymes at other adults. But they’re a great place to meet other people and as your baby starts to interact a bit more around the 12 week-mark, it all seems to make a bit more sense.

## St Paul’s Old Ford

It might not be the obvious place to hang out but [St Paul’s Church](https://romanroadlondon.com/st-pauls-church-old-ford-road/) hosts a number of baby classes (Sing and Sign, Baby Sensory), a weekly NCT meet up and has an affordable café with baby changing facilities and high chairs.

## Victoria Park

You can’t walk 100 yards without spotting a pram in [Victoria Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/) and there’s usually a congregation around both the [Pavilion Café](https://romanroadlondon.com/pavilion-victoria-park-cafe-a-sri-lankan-story/) and The Park Café on any given weekday, where you’re guaranteed to meet someone in a similar boat. The V&A Building (near the playpark up towards Victoria Park Village) hosts baby music class Piccolo for kids aged 0-5 and Hartbeeps, for newborns, babies and toddlers, while The Hub (by The Park Café) offers mum and baby yoga for babies aged between 1 and 9 months

## Mae + Harvey and Muxima

We are still mourning the loss of the Chesterfield but Roman Road has cafés in abundance.  The likes of [Mae + Harvey](https://romanroadlondon.com/mae-and-harvey-healthy-recipe-juices/) or [Muxima](https://romanroadlondon.com/best-brunch-bow-mile-end-globe-town/) are the perfect place to recharge after a long night with a piece of cake and both are very baby-friendly.

#### V&A Museum of Childhood

The sensory pod at the V&A Museum of Childhood in Bethnal Green is great for slightly older babies, with colour-changing lighting and a tactile wall, plus there’s a sandpit upstairs, which can be chaos when busy but is worth a look. The MOC also holds a daily story time and other events, but these are generally aimed at older children. There is a café, good shop and changing facilities too.
