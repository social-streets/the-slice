If you are looking for something to do with your dad this Father’s Day after the obligatory breakfast-in-bed, then you don’t need to go far to organise a special day. We have found all the best things to do right here on our doorstep. From a foodie trip to Victoria Park Market to climbing at the Hackney Wick boulder project or sampling freshly distilled gin at the East London Liquor Company, there is something for everyone.

## Victoria Park produce market

It has only been one year since [Victoria Park Market](https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-market/) launched, and it now attracts hordes of visitors to Bow’s leafy park every Sunday, rivalling nearby Broadway Market. Find fresh fruit and vegetables, delectable baked goods and the best hot street food around. If your dad has a sweet tooth, we recommend heading to A Pie Party for the tastiest pies money can buy. Bring your picnic hamper and take to the grass.  
_Visit Victoria Park Market at the Nightwalk, E2 9JW 10-4 on Sundays and keep up with them on Instagram here._

## Gin tasting and East London Liquor Company tour

For those dads with a taste of the finer things in life, a tour round the [East London Liquor Company](https://romanroadlondon.com/alex-wolpert-east-london-liquor-company/) will warm the gullet. This gin and whisky distillery offers tours of the barrels ageing in the basement, a lesson in the science of distilling, a glance at their huge copper distillers and a tasting session at the end. After the tour, pop to the bottle shop to pick up some of their London Dry Gin (it’s our favourite) and step into the restaurant for an Italian-inspired appetizer.

## Brunch at The Morgan Arms

Having nailed their Sunday lunches, [The Morgan Arms](https://romanroadlondon.com/best-brunch-bow-mile-end-globe-town/) is branching out into brunch. Their biggest splurge is their full English, and the biggest seller their Eggs Benedict. Expect a traditional menu and generous portions. The atmosphere is relaxed and cosy, with tables available to book for up to eight people and a secret garden at the side where you can catch the morning sun. You can also count on a brilliant Bloody Mary, made with a choice of infused vodkas, a subtle way for dads to relax a bit on a Sunday.  
The Morgan Arms serves brunch on Saturdays and Sundays from 10am-3pm.

## A walk at Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park

Once the graveyard of one of London’s most deprived areas, [Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/tower-hamlets-cemetery-park-mile-end/) (aka Mile End Cemetery) is now one of the biggest stretches of semi-wild woodland in London and provides a programme of activities for young and old, meaning that Father’s Day can be fun for dads and their kids. On Sunday 17th the Cemetery’s Soanes Centre is giving a magical talk on The Folklore of Wild Plants, telling stories about the plants in the cemetery.  Inspire the children then wander the woodlands and take a minute for some peace and quiet out of the city.

## A paddle with Moo Canoes

Hire a kayak or canoe in Hackney Wick or the Limehouse Basin with Moo Canoes, and spend the afternoon enjoying the canals with your dad. Launched in 2012 in an effort to make the waterways more accessible for everyone, these piebald vessels are a different way to see the sights of the East End. Open from 10am - 6pm at the weekends, call 07879909423 for more information. Best to book. Cost starts at £26 for the first hour and £10 for each hour after.

## March for men at the Olympic Park

The day before Father’s Day is the march for men at the Olympic Park. Join thousands of other men and women in a walk to raise money for prostate cancer. Walks can be two, five or ten kilometres and can be done at any pace with the whole family including pushchairs and wheelchairs. Do something charitable this Father’s Day and feel good about spending time with your dad.

## Bow Boat Company

If you really want to push the boat out this Father's Day, hire a canal boat from the Bow Boat Company and sail the day away on East London's canals. Hire starts at £130 per hour and the boats have a capacity of 12, so you can take the whole family. The hire includes a skipper and crew, so you don't need to worry about sailing, but just sitting back and enjoying the views with your dad.

## Hackney Wick Boulder project

For dads who love climbing, Father’s Day is a good opportunity to discover a new climbing wall. The taster sessions on offer at the Hackney Wick boulder project are the perfect way to give bouldering a go. After an hour with an instructor, you will know enough to go along by yourself (if you want to). It’s only £10 per climb, so it won’t break the bank.  
_Find them at Hackney Wick Boulder Project, 117 Wallis Road, London, E9 5LN._

## Proper Burger at Greedy Cow

If your dad is into lunch rather than brunch, head to the Greedy Cow. Enjoy a delicious (we mean really delicious) burger for just £7.50 or a rump steak for £19. We hear the kangaroo is pretty good too…  
_The Greedy Cow is at 2 Grove Road, E3 5AX_
