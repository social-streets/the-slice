Following a by-election earlier in the week, Abdi Mohamed beat out three candidates to secure his spot as Councillor for Bow East

Abdi Mohamed has been elected as a Member of Tower Hamlets Council for the Bow East ward, following the by-election on Thursday 12 September 2024. The by-election was held to replace former councillor Rachel Blake, who resigned following her recent election as a Labour MP for the Cities of London and Westminster.

Councillor Mohamed of the Labour Party received 1,266 votes, followed by Rupert George of the Green Party, who received 722 votes.

In addition, Robin William Edwards of the Conservative Party received 239 votes, while Siobhan Linzi Proudfoot of the Liberal Democrats received 148 votes. The turnout for the constituency was 15.18 per cent.

Councillor Mohamed was born and raised in Bow East. Before his election, he spent three and a half years working for Tower Hamlets Council on casework and then for Newham Council, developing a borough-wide strategy to tackle modern slavery. He currently works for a national disability charity.

[When we asked him the biggest issues facing Bow East ahead of the election](https://romanroadlondon.com/september-2024-by-election-bow-east-explained/), he listed poor quality landlords, anti-social behaviour and protecting parks and green space. When asked why he should be elected Councillor Mohamed added 'I am the candidate with the experience of tackling the bureaucracy of Tower Hamlets Council, taking on rogue private landlords and housing associations.'

In a post on Instagram following his election, Councillor Mohamed said:

'It’s an honour to be elected as your newest Councillor. Thank you for placing your trust in me and the \[Labour\] Party.

Bow East is where I was born, grew up and proudly live - our area means so much to me, I’m determined to work hard for you.

A special shoutout to the amazing \[London Labour\] activists who helped so much during this campaign, especially on polling day!'
