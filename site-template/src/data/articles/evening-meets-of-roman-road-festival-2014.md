Roman Road's shops and businesses stayed open late and turned Bow's village high street into a string of pop-up stages, theatres and cinemas for a week of cultural events that showcased Bow's talent. At a time when Roman Road's high street is normally shut up behind metal rollers, The Roman was buzzing with evening activity.

We had a night of music (and jam sandwiches) at Bow Jam at the Roman Road Art Cafe; pop-up cinema nights at Costa Coffee and [Muxima](https://romanroadlondon.com/muxima-arts-cafe-music-venue/); spoken word from the stars of the future at Fiesta Cafe; a gig at St Barnabas church; readings at Best of India restaurant and Zealand Road Coffee Shop; origami art at [SNAP](https://romanroadlondon.com/shop/snap/); fashion shows at Gallery 504; [pizza-making classes at Domino's Pizza](https://romanroadlondon.com/pizza-making-roman-road-festival-2014); late night Sip & Shop events at Zee & Co and [Anchor+Hope](https://romanroadlondon.com/shop/anchor-hope/), and [dog portraits at Gina's Closet quirky pavement shoot](https://romanroadlondon.com/sarah-ainslie-pooch-portraits-roman-road-festival) - there was even a clairvoyant evening at Roman Cars, the local minicab office. Heres's a selection of photos - by no means comprehensive - of some of Roman Road Festival's Evening Meets.

The Evening Meets included a series of Create & Make events that encouraged young and old to try new skills and to discover new shops on Roman Road. From Domino’s hugely popular ‘make your own pizza then eat it’ workshop, through to the packed origami session at [SNAP gift store](https://romanroadlondon.com/shop/snap/) and the Stitch & Sew night at [Sew Amazing](https://romanroadlondon.com/robb-myers-sew-amazing-sewing-machine-fixer/), these events really showed how much fun you can have on the high street.
