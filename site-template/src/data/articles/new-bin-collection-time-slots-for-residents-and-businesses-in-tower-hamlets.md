The Council has announced the official times and rules of the new refuse collection service that will collect rubbish twice daily in two-hour slots.

Tower Hamlets Council is changing the way it collects rubbish from residents and businesses in a bid to stop piles of waste sitting on its streets for extended periods.

From December, residents and businesses in certain areas will be given two-hour daily time slots during which to put out their rubbish with the council issuing warnings to those who put it out at any other times.

The new service will run twice daily meaning two separate two-hour time slots are allocated on whatever your bin day is, giving two opportunities to get it collected, and will run from Monday through to Sunday.

The streets with new time slots are:

- Bell Lane

- Bethnal Green Road

- Bow Road

- Brick Lane

- Burdett Road

- Cambridge Heath Road

- Cannon Street Road

- Cheshire Street

- Cobb Street

- Commercial Road

- Commercial Street

- East India Dock Road

- Fashion Street

- Goulston Street

- Grove Road

- Hackney Road

- Hanbury Street

- Leman Street

- Middlesex Street

- Mile End Road

- New Goulston Street

- New Road

- Osborn Street

- Princelet Street

- Redchurch Street

- Roman Road

- Vine Court

- Wentworth Street

- White Church Lane

- Whitechapel High Street

- Whitechapel Road

Both residents and businesses on time-banded streets can check their allocated time slots on the council’s website at forms.towerhamlets.gov.uk/service/Check\_your\_timebanding.

Bins will then be collected within two hours of the end of the time slot.

Cabinet members discussed the plans during a meeting last month [(read the AI generated summary of the Tower Hamlets Cabinet Meeting held on 11 September 2024)](https://romanroadlondon.com/notices/council-meeting-cabinet-meeting-discusses-time-banded-waste-collections/) and the changes were officially approved at a full council meeting on October 2.

The council hopes the new service will significantly reduce ‘visual clutter’ on its streets, will help to improve overall street cleanliness and attractiveness and will clamp down on people illegally dumping rubbish.

Shafi Ahmed, Cabinet Member for Environment and the Climate Emergency, said: 'We are introducing these changes because we have seen how well they work in other busy areas of London and we are determined to deliver a service that meets the needs of our busy high street areas.

'The council will be working hard to ensure residents and businesses are aware and informed of the changes over the next few months.'

Tower Hamlets Council is the latest local authority to introduce timed waste collections, with Barnet, Enfield, Newham, Hackney, and the City of London already adopting the service across town centres and busy roads.

The council has said if businesses close before the evening time collection, they can store their rubbish in their premises overnight so it’s ready for the morning collection.

Residents are also not allowed to leave their rubbish out the night before and will be given a warning by the council if they leave waste outside of their specific time slots.

Tower Hamlets Mayor, Lutfur Rahman, said: 'This new waste and recycling arrangement is a significant aspect of the £5 million investment into improving the efficiency and long-term delivery of the waste service and working towards a cleaner, greener borough.

We are the most densely populated borough in the country, which means we have to be flexible and creative to deliver an excellent waste service that works for our residents and businesses.'

The council has said it will monitor the scheme for 12 months before it decides whether to continue or expand the service to other streets. More information can be found here.
