The 'family friendly' Victoria Park food market will be allowed to trade and sell alcohol on Saturdays in addition to already operating on Sundays following council approval last week

Victoria Park Market, which is located on a street in Victoria Park, has been selling local food produce, farm produce, as well as street food and drinks since 2017.

For the past seven years, the market has operated on just Sundays, however, a licensing application had been submitted to Tower Hamlets Council so it could also trade on Saturdays and serve alcohol between 11 am to 5 pm.

During a meeting with the council’s licensing sub-committee on July 9, Max Kennedy from Victoria Park Market said that there had not been 'one single issue' when it came to selling alcohol on Sundays.

He said: 'Fundamentally, because the market is a family-friendly daytime event where the community comes together to enjoy great food in the park, it’s not an event where anyone comes to drink excessively.

Anyone who has visited Victoria Park Market will instantly see that.

He said the market has been run 'very professionally' and has met the licensing objectives.

Mr Kennedy went on to say the market has not had any issues while it’s operated under Temporary Event Notices (TENs) on Saturdays for the past two months.

Penny Wrout, a Hackney councillor who represents Victoria ward which borders the park, said she was objecting to both extending the licence and the sale of alcohol on Saturdays.

Cllr Wrout said: 'None of my constituents have been asked for their opinions about any of this… so that’s a total failure of a consultation as far as the Hackney side is concerned.

'…people feel they are having a civic amenity taken away for the entire weekend, in other words, that end of the park becomes dominated by the market activities for the whole of the weekend.'

She said if the licence was granted for Saturdays, it would have a 'real impact' on families who don’t have a garden for their children to play in.

Cllr Wrout added: 'I think the nature of the market needs to be addressed too because while the Sunday market does sell food, the Saturday market is primarily a highly-priced street food market.

'It’s not really aimed at local people. It’s aimed at attracting people into the area who aren’t necessarily residents.'

Cllr Wrout also raised concerns about a lack of toilets and the impact this has had on the park environment.

She claimed people tend to go into the bushes to use the toilet, which has an impact on the biodiversity of the park and the safety of wooded areas for children.

Rosie Walker, a resident who was representing her neighbours on the Victoria Park Estate, argued the market was 'not for the local people' and said residents weren’t consulted on the Saturday plans.

She said: 'We just feel as local residents it’s detrimental in terms of noise, crowds, traffic and parking.'

Mr Kennedy said people who had responded to a survey carried out by the local community group, Friends of Victoria Park wanted to see more of his market in the park.

During closing arguments, Cllr Wrout said the council should not grant the licence until a proper consultation had been done with residents.

She said: 'The Friends of Victoria Park survey was an online survey and did not target local people so I think there’s a requirement on both Hackney’s and Tower Hamlets’ sides to understand what residents feel.'

Mr Kennedy said: 'This Saturday market has already been running for eight weeks, there have been zero complaints. The Sunday market has been running for 350 Sundays and there have been zero complaints.

'It’s taking up half an acre of a 250-acre park which is on a concrete street that is not used at all.'

Once the meeting had ended, the licensing sub-committee deliberated in private and decided to unanimously grant the licence.

According to a decision which was published on the council’s website a week later, the sub-committee added extra conditions to the licence including making sure stalls selling beer, natural wines or other alcohol not be located within 200 metres of anyone’s home.

Another condition read: 'Notices shall be prominently displayed at the site requesting patrons and stall staff to respect the needs of local residents and leave the area quietly.

'This should be enforced by market managers.'

Victoria Park Market is located on land between Bonner Gate and Gore Road.
