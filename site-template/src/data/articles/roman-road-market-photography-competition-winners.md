After weeks of submissions, two judging sessions and hours of deliberation, our panel have decided on the winners of the Roman Road Market Then & Now [photography competition](https://romanroadlondon.com/enter-roman-road-market-then-now-photography-competition/).

Our entrants took inspiration from [archive photographs](https://romanroadlondon.com/market-archive-old-images-60s-70s-80s-90s/) of the market from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. We received a huge range of entries - from little white dogs to dustbin men clearing up at the end of the day.

The first round of judging was done by the market traders themselves, who cast their votes on their favourite images. The following day we met for our second round of deliberations with three professional photographers who live locally: [Andrew Leo](https://www.andrewleophoto.com/index.html), [Katinka Herbert](https://www.instagram.com/katinka.inc/) and [Robin Forster](https://robinforsterphotography.com/).

After lots of debate, the judges decided on the winner, two highly commended entries, and the remaining seven shortlisted photos that will be exhibited at the Idea Store Bow.

Along with the winners, you are all invited to the [exhibition launch](https://romanroadlondon.com/event/roman-road-market-then-now-exhibition-launch/) on Thursday 31st May at the Idea Store Bow. Speaking at the event will be Melanie McGrath, author of Pie & Mash Down Roman Road.

## Roman Road Photographer of the Year

##### Linda Savini

Savini: 'Roman Road market stands resilient in its vibrant colours on a rainy ice-cold winter day. Roman Road Market mirrors its people: histories of the past intertwine with the present and enrich the future of the diverse and thriving East End communities'.

The judges were impressed with Savini’s composition and thought the moody skies were brilliantly atmospheric. They particularly liked the silhouette of the woman against the light. The wind, the rain and the cold didn’t stop Savini persevering with her camera – something the judges were really impressed with.

## Highly commended

##### Massimo Lannetti

Iannetti: 'I’d title this picture 'urgency yet not haste'. In fact, besides the iconic locality portrayed by the background, what I was interested in was the ability of this neighbourhood market to partially give up on its main characteristic, haste and consumeristic sense of take-over, to leave a more peaceful and familiar urgency, much more in accord with the locality, not with the fast-pace typical of this environment and London as a whole.'

Both the panel of professional photographers and the market traders loved this image. Again, they were really impressed with its composition with the shoppers crowded around the stall.

They picked up on its energy and action, commenting on how it made the market look bustling, exciting and optimistic. Finally, they were impressed with the old-fashioned aspect of the market Iannetti managed to capture: the old Wheelwrights cart.

##### Samantha Jane

Jane: 'This photograph captures some of the other people, other than the traders and other market staff, who have to be involved with the Roman Road Market for it to run successfully. One the traders leave there is still work to do.

'With the increase in packaging materials since the archived photographs were taken, today in 2018 it’s even more important to have proper waste procedures in place. This happens soon after the market finishes.'

Our professional judging panel thought this photo had serious impact. Jane’s technical skill is apparent in the composition and the sophisticated use of perspective.

They loved how the image was backlit and thought the grading was beautiful. In terms of subject matter, they thought this image was the most unusual – the rubbish collectors are the unsung heroes of the market.

## The other shortlisted exhibitors

The following images may not have been winners, but all showed outstanding qualities and were chosen as our shortlist of ten images to be exhibited at the Idea Store Bow from Thursday 31 May to the end of June.
