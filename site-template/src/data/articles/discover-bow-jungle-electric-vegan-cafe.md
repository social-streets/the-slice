Digital nomads, East End tradies and Bow’s best-loved drag queen come together at Roman Road’s unlikely melting pot

If any Roman Roadies rolled their eyes at another vegan establishment descending on the East End on 17 September 2022, there’s a good chance that Jungle Electric has won them over.

From its inception, Jungle Electric intended to be an inclusive space where everyone feels comfortable. Benches are strewn with brightly coloured pillows and leafy house plants line the cafe walls adding to its homely and inviting atmosphere. 

Whether you’re popping in for an energising green smoothie, or settling down for an afternoon of work, you never quite know who you will see in the cafe. 

From the builders working on the new development on Norman Grove to local drag queen, [Shandy Half-Pint](https://romanroadlondon.com/adria-alvarez-shandy-half-pint-drag-queen-bow-interview/), Jungle Electric has become an unlikely melting pot for all members of our East End community. 

In November 2022, the cafe became Roman Road’s [first certified ‘Safe Place’](https://romanroadlondon.com/jungle-electric-safe-place-women/) on the SafeUP app which aims to make women and girls feel safe, protected and empowered in all community spaces. 

Though such safety measures are more applicable to nighttime venues, owners Christopher Tyerman and Alex Navarro said it was important to them to promote the importance of safety in all public spaces and encourage other businesses to do the same. 

The cafe is equipped with a water station, strong wifi, and plenty of plugs and has quickly become a favourite spot for [Roman Road’s digital nomads](https://romanroadlondon.com/best-cafes-to-work-from/). 

Beetroot and turmeric lattes (don’t knock them till you try them) are made with care by Barista Alex who is a master of ‘latte art’ which you can find on the cafe’s Instagram page. 

While you’re there, we’d recommend giving their page a follow. Navarro and Tyerman are not camera-shy and often post entertaining reels keeping us informed about the menu’s newest vegan treat. 

Earlier this year, Jungle Electic went head to head with Greggs in a blind taste test to be crowned Roman Road’s [best vegan sausage roll](https://romanroadlondon.com/greggs-jungle-electric-vegan-sausage-roll-taste-test/). Despite being twice the price of the high street chain, a unanimous vote from the Roman Road LDN team saw Jungle Electic take the title.

And don’t just take it from us, we hear these plant-based pastries are also a favourite of Daniel from [Delan Jewellers](https://romanroadlondon.com/delan-jewellery-shop-interview/), who is often known to pop across the Roman and buy two for lunch.

More than just a plant-based cafe, Jungle Electric was granted an alcohol license soon after it opened and frequently hosts open mic nights, drag karaoke, bingo and film sing-a-longs. 

From _High School Musical, Mama Mia,_ and _Grease_, keep an eye on [our events listings](https://romanroadlondon.com/events/) for what musical is coming next. Considering Tyerman’s background in musical theatre, we’re hoping for a solo from the Jungle Electric owner himself.
