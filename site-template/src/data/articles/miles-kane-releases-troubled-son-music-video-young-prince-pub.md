Starring in the video among Kane’s friends and actor James Buckley is landlord Barry Holloway, pulling pints in one of our oldest East End boozers.

Liverpudlian indie musician and Bethnal Green resident Miles Kane has released a new music video filmed in the Young Prince pub on Roman Road. 

The video, _Troubled Son_, sees Kane strolling through one of our area’s last proper East End boozers, playing darts, greeting friends, and being served by local landlord Barry Holloway. 

The action includes Kane, 37, taking a call outside the pub, where you catch a glimpse of Reid’s Hair Salon across the road and other Roman Road businesses on a grey March day. 

According to Holloway, the video was shot in one take, with the camera following Kane from the Young Prince’s surprisingly [spacious beer garden](https://romanroadlondon.com/best-beer-gardens/) through the dimly lit pub where the dark wooden panels are covered in darts boards, framed photos and old football awards. 

Released on YouTube on Tuesday 18 April, Kane gives a shoutout to our local pub landlord in the video’s caption, writing: ‘Thanks to Barry and Maxine at The Young Prince, Roman Road London and to all me mates who came down on the day. Love you all. X’

_Troubled Son_ is the first single to be released from the album ‘One Man Band’, Kane’s fifth solo album which is set to come out on 4 August 2023. 

Merseyside-born indie music veteran, Kane is known both as the co-frontman of The Last Shadow Puppets, along with Artic Monkeys' lead singer Alex Turner, and as a successful solo artist. 

Speaking to NME music magazine, Kane said that the single represented the album as a whole: ‘It’s like looking at myself in the mirror and acknowledging my faults, my fears, and sort of showing my journey.’ 

On the guest appearance of _The Inbetweeners_ actor, James Buckley, in the music video, Kane said that the pair are friends and that he wanted the video to show what he does with mates: ‘something just super real and not too posed.’

Though Kane is most often found drinking at the Sun Tavern on Bethnal Green Road, after a day at the Young Prince we expect he’ll become a Roman Road regular in no time. You can’t beat a sunny pint in the East End’s best-hidden beer garden after all.
