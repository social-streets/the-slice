_The Slice_'s fifth issue is a special Grime edition to coincide with BBC's new TV series Grime Kids released this November and celebrates the music's genesis on the streets and estates around Roman Road.

This fifth issue of The Slice has been hard to put together. While we were working on it, someone close to me became very ill and needed constant support.

It meant I had to take personal leave when the deadlines for the designer and printers were looming. Luckily, friends, neighbours, family and the small team of two at _The Slice_ rallied to help.  My personal network of support came together in a time of adversity to create this issue.

It struck me that this spirit of comradeship, this willingness to come together and help people in adversity, is the spirit that marked the evolution of grime music in Bow, the topic we celebrate in this issue to coincide with BBC’s Grime Kids, a new TV series based on DJ Target’s book of the same name.

Grime was born from a generation of young people living around Roman Road in the 1990s and early noughties who faced their own adversity and came together as a community to create a movement of music that provided a voice for the invisible and unheard.  

Distinctively, the grime music scene was made up of crews; collectives of young musicians, videographers, photographers, MCs and radio DJs who supported each other in unity to create music about life on East End housing estates.

Dizzee Rascal, Tinchy Strider and Wiley, among others, all sprung from our neighbourhood and have inspired the likes of Dave, Kano, and Stormzy, helping to create a uniquely Black and British sound that has defined UK rap as being separate from US rap.

At a time when I am grateful for the support of my crew, I can see how crucial a sense of brotherhood was in creating one of the most significant musical developments in the UK. Whether or not grime is your sound, it shows what can be achieved as a community. 

Published by Social Streets C.I.C., the not-for-profit digital media company that publishes Roman Road LDN, this edition of _The Slice_ features sustainable organisations and initiatives across Tower Hamlets showing that the climate emergency and the cost-of-living crisis can be fought side-by-side.

Social Streets’ founder Tabitha Stapely said: ‘_The Slice_ is more thoughtful, more inspiring and more community-led than most local publications. 

‘Compared to more conventional local newspapers that have a more sensationalist and often inflammatory approach to news, we focus on constructive journalism that shows both sides of the argument and tries to find solutions to local issues.’
