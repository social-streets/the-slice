A brand new two-weekend festival is coming to Victoria Park this June in addition to the popular All Points East in August, adding to the park's culture offering and Council's coffers.

AEG Presents has announced LIDO Festival at Victoria Park, a two-weekend music festival to be held in June 2025 with a line-up of music acts to be announced soon. 

This year, AEG Presents' festival All Points East will also be held 15 to 24 August 2025 in Victoria Park for the eighth year running.

The announcement comes after [a controversial decision made by the council in November 2023 to increase the amount and capacity of major events allowed in the park.](https://romanroadlondon.com/tower-hamlets-council-increase-major-events-victoria-park/) The amount of days permitted for major events increased from 10 to 12 yearly, whereas the capacity threshold increased from 5,000 to 20,000. 

Mayor Lutfur Rahman argued that the changes were a necessary step to improve the borough’s finances and avoid bankruptcy. Residents and community groups, including Friends of Victoria Park, have complained about litter and noise from the events and argued that the frequency of festivals make the park inaccessible for local enjoyment. 

The LIDO festival is the first result of the new policy and its announcement is expected to be controversial. 

Named after the Lido field in Victoria Park, the festival aims to have sustainable policies to manage waste disposal and will partner with local food vendors to ensure sustainable efficiency. 

Like All Points East, organisers AEG say that the LIDO festival will aim to bring improvements to the park, engage with local suppliers and boost local spending. 

Councillor Kamrul Hussain, Cabinet Member for Culture and Recreation said: ‘This new festival has the potential to provide more opportunities for residents to benefit from cultural events and generate more income to support council services including the upkeep of our parks.’

LIDO festival will have a midweek programme providing free, arts, culture and well-being activities. 

There will be an ongoing partnership with East London Arts and Music (ELAM) to provide students with real-world opportunities in the creative industry. 

Jim King, CEO of European Festivals at AEG Presents said: ‘Taking place at Victoria Park, one of our favourite locations in the heart of London’s creative districts, Lido Festival allows us to push our ambitions further in working with young people in the music industry.’

LIDO festival headliners, full line ups and programmes are to be announced.
