Local residents have teamed up with wine shop Vinarius to set up a Food Assembly in Roman Road.

Local Bow residents Laura Polazzi and Ioana Dragomir have teamed up with Roman Road's wine shop Vinarius to launch Roman Road's first ever Food Assembly.

"We are local residents and want to contribute to improve the food offer available on our high street" explains Polazzi. "High quality local produce is not easy to find in Roman Road, and the Food Assembly would be a new great shopping opportunity for many residents. As a weekly meetup in a friendly wine bar, this initiative would also help bring the community together."

Food Assemblies are set up and managed by local people who want to bring fresh, seasonal and local produce to the community. Every week the Food Assembly takes place in a local venue. You can either order your food online to collect that day or visit on the day to browse and shop.

The weekly pop-up food market is an opportunity for the community to exchange much more than just food. It's also an opportunity to meet both your neighbours and the people behind your food as well as attend seasonal events and foodie workshops.

The Food Assembly supports sustainable agriculture, locally sourced (within 150 miles) fresh produce and fair prices.

The Roman Road Food Assembly will gather every Thursday between 6:00-7:30pm at Vinarius on Roman Road, where members will be able to meet producers and other people from the community who care about the environment and share their passion for healthy eating.

Laura and Ioana need 200 members to launch the Food Assembly. To become a member and help them get started [join the Roman Road Food Assembly here](https://thefoodassembly.com/en/assemblies/7380 "Roman Road Food Assembly"). Don't worry, you won't be committing to anything at this point and won't be receiving unwanted emails.
