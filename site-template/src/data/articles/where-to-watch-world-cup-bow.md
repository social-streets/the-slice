Hackney Wick boasts a [plethora of bars](https://romanroadlondon.com/hackney-wick-bars-restaurants-raves/), restaurants, and breweries, ranging from Howling Hops to the unique Barge East floating on the opposite side of the canal. However, standing out in the crowd is [the Lord Napier Star](https://romanroadlondon.com/lord-napier-star-voted-best-rooftop-bar/), the neighbourhood's only pub. This is no ordinary historic tavern; instead, it's a vibrant and contemporary establishment renowned for its vivid graffiti-covered exterior. The Lord Napier is a hub of activity, hosting a packed weekly agenda featuring quizzes, DJs, and delectable curries. As an added bonus for sports enthusiasts, Lord Napier screens all of the England Rugby World Cup matches, along with many other games from the tournament.

_Find the Lord Napier Star on 25 White Post Ln, E9 5EN._

Following [last year's renovations](https://romanroadlondon.com/coborn-pub-mile-end-reopens/), the Coborn pub exudes the timeless charm of an early 20th-century East End establishment. Adorned with rich mahogany-panelled walls and comfortable ox-blood leather button-back chairs, it provides an ideal backdrop for a relaxed and family-friendly rugby viewing experience. If you're planning to dine with a party of four or more, you'll even receive a complimentary round of Guinness to accompany your meal. For those seeking a more immersive rugby experience, the pub offers private viewings in the Rugby Locker Room, creating the perfect atmosphere for those eager to immerse themselves in the action.

If you're determined not to miss any of the Rugby this year, set up a bar tab at the Rusty Bike in Mile End and dive right in. This eccentric and vibrant sports pub is your go-to spot, broadcasting all the World Cup games on six high-definition screens, courtesy of Sky and BT sports coverage. Its eye-catching red parasols are impossible to overlook as you emerge from [Mile End tube station](https://romanroadlondon.com/mile-end-tube-luke-agbaimoni-photographs/), shading a spacious outdoor seating area abuzz with sports enthusiasts. And if hunger strikes during halftime, the Rusty Bike has you covered with an extensive menu of highly recommended Thai cuisine. Who can resist the temptation of a delicious Pad Thai paired with a pint?

![Green Goose Cardigan Road Bow East](/images/Green-Goose-Cardigan-Road-Bow-East-London-1024x703-1-1024x703.jpg)

If you're seeking a more refined experience, one where you can enjoy the World Cup while sipping on a refreshing spritz instead of juggling two pints of lager, then the Green Goose in Bow should be your destination of choice. Affectionately referred to as ‘The Goose’ by locals, this establishment boasts expansive period windows that bring in a brightness not typically found in Bow's traditional pubs. They're equipped with plenty of TVs for the World Cup season, but we recommend making advance reservations for England matches to secure your spot. If you happen to visit on a sunny day this week, you might even have the opportunity to catch the game in the pub's evergreen, astroturfed [beer garden.](https://romanroadlondon.com/best-beer-gardens/)

## The Crown

With a picturesque view of [Victoria Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/) from the balcony, the pub is an excellent choice for enjoying the tournament. Its stylish new seating arrangements and dining rooms provide an ideal setting for a meal and a drink. Like the Coborn around the corner and other Young's pubs, for groups of four or more, there's the added bonus of a complimentary round of Guinness. They are currently accepting reservations for the Rugby World Cup, or if you prefer, we recommend arriving early to secure a prime spot with a great view of one of the three screens downstairs.

_The Crown is located at 223 Grove Rd, Old Ford, E3 5SN._

## Little Driver

BEST FOR: PUB GARDEN
