Roman Road Yard Market was launched on Saturday 19 March 2016 ([see the market launch event in pictures here](https://romanroadlondon.com/yard-market-open-day-success)). It is a new weekly market on Roman Road that runs every Saturday on the car park at the junction between Roman Road and St Stephen’s Road. It sells a wide range of wares with an emphasis on unique goods including collectables, vintage, mid-century and gifts, as well as locally produced or handmade arts and crafts.

The market is designed to compliment the existing street market, Roman Road Market, famous for its East End heritage, fashion stalls and fresh produce. Roman Road Yard Market alternates between Designer-Maker Saturdays and Vintage & Arts Saturdays.

The Yard Market is run by [Roman Road Trust](https://www.romanroadtrust.co.uk), a not-for-profit, community interest company (CIC) that works to put community at the heart of regeneration. All profits from the Yard Market will be reinvested into further community initiatives.

The community vibe of the market is loved by traders and shoppers alike. Two-thirds of traders, and all the street food sellers, are local. The market also hosts buskers and designer-maker workshops. One hundred per cent of visitors described the opening day as 'good' or 'very good; and Roman Road Trust was described as 'probably the best market operator I've ever know' by one trader.
