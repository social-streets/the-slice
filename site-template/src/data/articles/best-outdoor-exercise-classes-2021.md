Nothing beats exercising in the fresh air with friends. Here’s our round up of the best outdoor exercise classes around Roman Road.

One thing many people are looking forward to on [March 29th](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-restrictions-posters-29-march-2021) is being able to take part in formally organised outdoor sports again. After a year of lock down, many of us are a bit fed up with living room workouts and desperate to experience the camaraderie and motivation offered by classes.

The evolution of the outdoor exercise class has leapt forward during the pandemic and over the last year we’ve seen our green spaces playing host to various types of fitness fun. Whether you’re a yoga buddy, a boxing fanatic or a frisbee enthusiast, there really is something for everyone.  So dust off your rackets, sneakers, and yoga mats and get ready to bring your workout al fresco.

Young and older players can learn with equipment adapted to each age group, make new friends, and even take one-to-one classes with an LTA Accredited Coach.

1Rebel is a high intensity, dual studio fitness concept which normally offers no-contract classes aimed at subverting the traditional fitness model. Workouts with 1Rebel revolve around three concepts: Ride, which is their spinning concept, Rumble, namely their boxing concept, and Reshape, which includes running and weights. The good news is that even though their high tech studios in Central London won’t be accessible until late May, they’ll offer outdoor sessions as of the 29th of March in Victoria Park (and Clapham Common).
