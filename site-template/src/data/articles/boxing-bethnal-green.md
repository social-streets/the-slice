Bethnal Green is home to both iconic boxing venues and fighters. But why does this part of the East End have such a long-standing association with boxing?

Bethnal Green and the wider East End is renowned for its association with boxing. The area has produced many great boxers over the years from Daniel Mendoza, credited with inventing the left jab, to former welterweight world champion John H Stracey. 

But just why is boxing so popular in the East End? 

‘If you could fight then you were a real man,’ said Sammy McCarthy, a former British featherweight champion and Stepney resident when interviewed for Alex Daley’s book, [_Fighting Men of London_.](https://www.facebook.com/londonboxers/)

## Bringing people together through boxing

Here in Bethnal Green, boxercise classes have become popular with city workers who frequent expensive gyms, but this form of boxing is a far cry from what the sport traditionally looks like in our area.

Boxing has been a source of pride in the East End and a way for people to assert their identity and belonging, no matter what background,

Historically, boxing has always thrived on the macho stereotype. As boxer McCarthy said, being able to fight was a sign you were a “real man”.

Recently though, boxing has become more diverse. Professional kickboxer Ruqsana Begum was born into a traditional and religious Bangladeshi household in Bethnal Green. She trains out of KO Boxing Gym in Bethnal Green, where legendary owner [Bill Judd](https://romanroadlondon.com/bill-judd-ko-boxing-muay-thai-combat-academy-gym/) has inspired generations of young boxers.  

Begum is a kickboxing champion and a coach for Fight for Peace, a charity which uses boxing as a prevention and rehabilitation model to confront the problem of child and youth participation in crime, gangs and gun violence within disadvantaged communities

Women like [Ruqsana Begum are fighting the stereotype that boxing in East London](https://romanroadlondon.com/ruqsana-begum-muay-thai-female-fighter/) is only for testosterone-fuelled men. Her work with the charity Fight for Peace shows that the sport can also be a place to redirect young people away from crime and onto a path that can use their energy more productively.

Even though boxing is a sport where competitors fight against each other, it can bring unity too. Daniel Mendoza was a Jewish fighter in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Born Whitechapel and raised in Bethnal Green, Mendoza lived in the iconic row of houses that line [Paradise Row](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/paradise-gardens-bethnal-green-history/); a blue plaque bearing his name can still be seen attached to the house where he lived.

 At a time when antisemitism was rife in London, Mendoza styled himself as “Mendoza the Jew”, proudly celebrating his heritage. He brought forward a new style of boxing and published the book “The Art of Boxing”. Through his pursuit of boxing, he won the respect of many despite the pervasive discrimination Jewish people faced at the time.

Legendary East End boxing and the [Repton boxing club](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/repton-boxing-club-history/) go hand in hand. Proud of its Bethnal Green roots, you won’t find boxercise classes at the Repton.

Repton Boxing Club has been around since 1884, and many Bethnal Greeners have great memories from the club. 

One man who looms large in many of these memories is Tony Burns MBE. Tony Burns passed away in January 2021. He had spent 45 years at Repton Boxing Club. The tributes that poured out for him showed the impact that the boxing coach had on generations of young boxers who passed through Repton. 

Darren Barker, a professional boxer who won gold at the Commonwealth Games in 2002, paid tribute to Tony Burns. 

‘The man was a legend who spent most of his life down his beloved Repton ABC helping the fighters fulfil their dreams. I will cherish all the great times we shared together. I owe him so much,’ he said. 

Legendary coaches like Tony Burns are a key part of what makes boxing in the East End so great. Clubs like Repton would be nothing without dedicated individuals like Tony Burns.

## Boxing venues in the East End

The East End was one of the poorest parts of London and still has areas with some of the highest deprivation in the country. Historically, part of the attraction to boxing may have been that it requires little or no equipment. It grew from bare-knuckle fighting that was common in the past and its boxing venues reflect its humble origins.

The [York Hall on Old Ford Road,](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/york-hall-boxing-night-blood-solidarity-photoessay/) Bethnal Green is one of the most famous boxing venues in the country. It contains a ring, some wooden seating and not much else. The venues ensure that the fights remain the centre of attention. 

Just down the road from Bethnal Green, another famous venue was the [Mile End Arena](https://romanroadlondon.com/boxing-arena-mile-end-history/). Now demolished, it made York Hall look plush in comparison.  It was situated behind Mile End Tube Station and operated in the 1930s, 40s and 50s. 

The Mile End Arena was made out of crumbling brick and corrugated iron. It was uncovered and the floor often got so muddy that fighters had to be piggy-backed into the ring. Despite the basic nature of the Arena it would attract up to 3,000 spectators to see local boxers compete and was famously where the [Kray twins made their professional boxing debut](https://romanroadlondon.com/kray-twins-boxing-careers/).

Still today, boxing can draw in a large crowd in the East End, especially when a local is fighting. York Hall retains its international reputation, hosting boxing events regularly, including styles popular in [South America such as Lucha Libre.](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/lucha-libre-mexican-wrestling-york-hall-photo-essay/)

Harvey Horn is a flyweight boxer, he told promoter Frank Warren about the thrill of boxing in York Hall as an East Ender. 

‘They’re hardcore knowledgeable fans and once the MC announces you’re from Bethnal Green, the place just goes mental!’ Harvey Horn said. 

Bethnal Green’s long-standing association with boxing is deeply rooted in the culture, history, and identity of the East End. From legendary fighters like Daniel Mendoza to trailblazers like Ruqsana Begum, boxing in this area has transcended stereotypes and become a powerful symbol of resilience, community, and pride.

Iconic venues like York Hall and clubs such as Repton have preserved the raw, minimalistic spirit of the sport, while individuals like Tony Burns have played a crucial role in nurturing generations of talent. Despite its brutal nature, boxing in the East End unites people from all walks of life, offering them a path to channel their energy and achieve greatness. In Bethnal Green, boxing is not just a sport; it’s a tradition that continues to inspire and bring people together. You need only witness the crowds at York Hall, or kids joining up at Repton, to know that boxing still runs in the lifeblood of the East End.
