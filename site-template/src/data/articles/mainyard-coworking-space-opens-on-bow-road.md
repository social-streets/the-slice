Mainyard Studios has opened a new coworking space at 35 Bow Road.

The space, which is in the process of being fully renovated, has 15 studios and 24 coworking desks across three floors, as well as a garden, a communal kitchen area, and a roof terrace.

Although the bottom two floors are operating, with several small businesses already moving in, work continues on the second floor and in the garden. A U-shaped building of 10 additional offices is planned for the latter.

It is housed in a 1930s building on the north side of Bow Road in between Central Foundation School and Bow Police Station. Formerly used by the Council, the building was empty when Mainyard took it over, but still retained parquet flooring and its original staircase.

Mainyard is planning to have a mural painted on the front of the building and is in talks with several potential artists.

Mainyard Studios is a business that converts unused buildings into affordable office space. The Bow Road office joins sites in Wimbledon, Walthamstowe, and Hackney Wick.

The new space is running two summer promotions for its desks. The first of these is a start-up discount, in which month one will cost £100, two £150, and three £200. This applies to any new members who have started their business within the last six months.

The other promotion is a multiple desk discount. For members who second and third desks, they pay -15% and -30% on each.
