The Victoria is an award-winning East End boozer with a menu tailor-made for seafood lovers. Over the past two years, The Victoria has transformed its first floor into a luxury private dining room offering visitors a chance to escape the hustle and bustle of the ground-floor pub for an exclusive bar experience.

This Christmas, The Victoria has designed a two and three-course festive dining menu packed with mouth-watering seafood options. To start, why not enjoy some treacle-cured trout rosti, or smoked mackerel pate with cranberry sauce on a fresh crostini? If you find yourself bored of the classic pub roast dinner, swap tired turkey for a cod fillet with cauliflower purée, or a whole seabream with samphire.

Dive into this seasonal menu of locally sourced fish in The Victoria’s ground floor or private dining room, but make sure to book. While the pub is closed for Christmas and Boxing Day, the festive menu is available throughout December. Two courses are £36 and three courses for £40.

The Green Goose is a classic East End pub, just a stone’s throw away from the Roman Road. Its rustic and cosy interiors are sure to provide a peaceful sanctuary away from the busy streets of London this Christmas. 

If you fancy eating out on Christmas Day, pay a visit to the Green Goose and you’ll find yourself immediately greeted by a glass of fizz and a Cornish crab on toast canapé. Diners will be spoilt for choice, with roast Norfolk bronze turkey, roasted sirloin dry-aged beef and sweet potato Wellington to pick between.

If you have a sweet tooth, you’re in luck. Classic Christmas pudding, a British cheese board, sticky toffee pudding and a mysterious chocolate nemesis dish are all on offer. If that’s not enough to tempt you, the festive feast closes with mince pies for all. £75 per head for adults, £45 per head for children under 12.

If you want to enjoy your Christmas roast by firelight this year, book yourself into the Coborn.  Mahogany panelled walls and ox-blood leather button-back chairs await you in the aptly named Snug, a cosy side room ideal for an intimate, family affair. 

The Coborn is cooking up a storm on Christmas Day with a vast selection of festive treats. There’s something for everyone in their vast array of starters, including baked South Coast scallops, Hampshire venison carpaccio and a roast cauliflower soup with a chestnut gremolata to warm you up.

Whether you’re partial to English turkey, West Country beef, roast turbot, or a wild mushroom and beetroot Wellington, The Corborn Christmas menu has you covered. Whichever main you pick, your plate will arrive packed full of double egg Yorkshire pudding, goose fat roast potatoes and brussels sprouts with gravy. Adults pay £95, while children eat for £48.

If you’re not around on Christmas Day, visit The Coborn throughout December to try out the ‘Christmas Feast’ menu, available for £40 per person. From parsnip and celeriac nut roast to Hampshire Chalk Stream trout, this decadent feast is full of rich flavours and complimentary pairings. Apple, fig & chestnut crumble or a spiced winter fruit Bakewell awaits you for dessert.

The Morgan Arms is a beautiful East London boozer, recognisable by its pastel blue facade, pinstripe awning and the wildflower hanging baskets on either side of the entrance.

This local favourite balances classic East End traditionalism alongside comfortable modernity: modern European cuisine can be enjoyed whilst seated in rickety, mismatched furniture. 

For £85 per person, the Morgan Arms is treating you to a Christmas Day feast like no other. If you’re a devout foodie, just hearing about the menu will have you counting down the days to the big day. The crab and crayfish cocktail starter is sure to please fish lovers, while our ethically-minded friends might be tempted by the pumpkin, spinach & vegan feta cheese tart topped off with toasted pecans.

There are too many delicious mains to list, but standouts include the butter-roasted turkey with sage and pork stuffing and the venison steak served alongside fondant potato. If the classic Christmas pudding for dessert doesn’t satisfy you, mince pies and chocolate orange spiced judge are available for afters.

Visit Morganarmsbow.com for more information.

Recently refurbished, the Crown is just a stone’s throw away from the scenic and peaceful West Lake of Victoria Park. The vintage-style pub is also just a half-hour stroll from London Fields, making it the perfect destination for a post-walk Christmas lunch. The pub spans over two floors with a secret gin bar upstairs and a balcony overlooking the leafy wilderness of Victoria Park.

On the big day, treat yourself to a Jerusalem artichoke tart followed by a Gressingham duck Wellington or a Driftwood goat’s cheese & pear salad, if you’re a vegetarian. Whether you’re partial to something deliciously sweet or savoury and salty, the Crown’s dessert menu covers all bases. Enjoy a full-proof cheese board of Long Clawson Stilton and Driftwood goat’s cheese, or go with your heart and order the salted chocolate, hazelnut & kirsch cherry mousse.
