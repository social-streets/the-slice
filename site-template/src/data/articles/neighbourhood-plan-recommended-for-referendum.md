Six and a half years after the first public meeting to discuss the idea of a neighbourhood plan for Bow, the final version of a neighbourhood plan for Bow has been recommended by its independent examiner to proceed to local referendum:

‘I recommend that the Plan, once modified, proceeds to referendum on the basis that it has met all the relevant legal requirements.’

##### What are neighbourhood plans?

Neighbourhood plans are plans for a defined area that are made by local people rather than the local authority. They were legislated for in the 2011 Localism Act, and give more power to local communities, but must meet a set of legal conditions.

In London, the plans are developed by neighbourhood forums. Once adopted, local councils use them to help them decide on planning applications.

In London, many plans take four or more years to complete, and the process is demanding and complicated. If approved at a referendum, the Bow plan would be in force until 2031.

##### Can neighbourhood plans cover any issue, such as local transport?

No, they have to be concerned with the use and development of land, and so can only tackle issues such as transport indirectly. Transport for London is the responsible body for public transport, but Bow’s neighbourhood plan does have a policy to encourage safer walking and cycling routes across the area.

Adopted neighbourhood plans in Tower Hamlets form part of the Development Plan which consists of the Tower Hamlets Local Plan 2031, the Mayor of London’s London Plan 2021 and all neighbourhood plans. Neighbourhood plan policies also have to support the strategic policies of the local and London plans, and this is another restriction.

Information about current neighbourhood plans in Tower Hamlets is available on the Council’s [website](https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/planning_and_building_control/planning_policy_guidance/neighbourhood_planning/neighbourhood_planning.aspx)

##### What are the main themes of the final version of neighbourhood plan for Bow?

1. A thriving high street and local economy

3. Green streets that encourage walking and cycling

5. Beautiful public spaces

7. New life for our local heritage

9. High-quality affordable housing

11. A resilient and well-networked community infrastructure

##### Where can I read the draft plan?

The plan and supporting evidence are on the [Forum website](https://romanroadbowneighbourhoodplan.org/plan) along with supporting documents, including the examiner’s report and a consultation statement describing the community engagement at different stages.

#####  What happens next?

The Council is required by law to issue a decision statement over the examiner’s recommendation for a local referendum. The [Neighbourhood Forum](https://romanroadlondon.com/places/roman-road-bow-neighbourhood-plan/) is hoping the Council cabinet meeting on 1st August will consider the matter and decide to proceed to referendum. If so, the referendum will have to be held by law within 56 days from the day after the Council decision.

All those who live in the plan area (Bow East and Bow West wards, excluding Fish Island) are eligible to vote.

##### How can I get involved?

- You can join the Neighbourhood Forum on its [website](https://romanroadbowneighbourhoodplan.org/join-forum). This entitles you to vote at Forum meetings, including the Annual General Meeting
