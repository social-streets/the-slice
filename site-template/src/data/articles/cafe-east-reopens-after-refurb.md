[Cafe East](https://romanroadlondon.com/cafe-east-roman-road-mustafa-has-interview/) reopened this week after finishing its first major refurbishment since opening for business in 2017.

The cafe, situated at 426 Roman Road, has been extended at the back to make space for improved kitchen facilities and open up access to a potential patio.

Improvements to the kitchen include a food preparation space built better suited to halal requirements, a salad dispenser, and new plumbing. Out front the floors have been revarnished and the walls repainted. Air conditioning and a new sound system have also been installed.

Mustafa Has, co-owner of the cafe, described the refurb as a chance to iron out the kinks of the original DIY build. ‘We’ve essentially looked to improve our flow,’ he said. ‘It’s nice to refresh everything now and again.’

New counter tops were acquired from [Citywood](https://www.citywood.co.uk/), and East London supplier of recycled and reclaimed timber, and have been treated to match the cafe’s original surfaces.

The cafe’s bathroom has been moved further back, opening up access to a potential patio/garden space belonging to the neighbouring property. The garden is not currently in use, but it is being explored as an option.

Cafe East’s seating capacity remains the same as it was pre-refurb, but the changes have made the space just that little bit roomier.

The interior and spirit of the cafe remain unchanged. It’s already bustling again.

_You can find Cafe East at 426 Roman Rd, London E3 5LU. It is open on weekdays 8am-5pm and weekends 9am-5pm_
