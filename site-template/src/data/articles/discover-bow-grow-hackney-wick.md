Well-known for its canalside concerts and diverse DJ nights, there’s even more going on at Grow, Hackney than most locals are aware of.

If you’ve been following our _Bucket list Bow_ series day by day, then congratulations! You’ve nearly made it to the weekend. 

Whether it’s been one of those weeks that you want to forget as soon as you clock off work or one that’s left you with a satisfying sense of achievement, Grow, Hackney Wick, has something to suit just about every mood. 

When travelling to Grow on foot (as opposed to by canal boat), you will see what appears to be a car park and junkyard at the end of Wallis Road in Hackney Wick. 

At first glance, it might not look like one of our area’s most [popular nighttime spots](https://romanroadlondon.com/hackney-wick-bars-restaurants-raves/), but if you follow the signs to Grow and head down a little alley at the far left end of the car park, you will find the canal-side transformed into an adult fun zone by night.

From enjoying its Mediterranean-inspired sustainable menu to having a drink on the canalside terrace, or dancing into the early hours in the converted sausage factory warehouse, there are many ways to wave in the weekend at Grow. 

Tonight, the Makin’ Moves team are returning to the [Regent’s Canal](https://romanroadlondon.com/regents-canal-boat-window-photos-rose-palmer/), with special guest DJ Amir from New York bringing you a night of soulful house music until 2 am. 

The venue’s packed weekly schedule sees emerging East End talent performing alongside international artists spanning genres, generations and cultures. 

Just last week, Grow hosted an earth-focused club night, an all-female, all-vinyl event, as well as its weekly roster of midweek chess and sewing clubs. 

If you’re getting tired of working from your bedroom, Grow is part of an ecosystem of artist studios and provides affordable desk and studio spaces for artists and creatives in [Hackney Wick](https://romanroadlondon.com/hackney-wick-things-to-do/). 

Since opening on the Regent’s Canal in 2014, Grow has been committed to ensuring affordable access to music and art even amid the cost of living crisis. 

The venue has a multitude of events that are under £5 or free of charge, so you can still enjoy live music and entertainment when you’re tightening your belt at the end of the month. 

Every Thursday, Grow’s house jazz band, Stratos, take to the stage before opening the jam up to any budding musicians who want to get involved. 

If you don’t have the courage to jam with Stratos, entry for non-musicians is £5 on the door, or you can book a table with a view of the stage to be serenaded while you eat. 

And if this article has been a torturous read whilst watching the clock tick slowly by, don’t worry. The weekend is nearly upon us. And there’s a cool canalside drink waiting for you at Grow with your name on it.
