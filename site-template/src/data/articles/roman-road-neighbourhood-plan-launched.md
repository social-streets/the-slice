A Neighbourhood Plan for Roman Road has been initiated by [Roman Road Trust](https://www.romanroadtrust.co.uk), and the Inaugural Public Meeting will be at 4pm on Saturday 20th February at St Paul's Church on St Stephen's Road.

A Neighbourhood Plan allows local residents and businesses to have their own planning policies in a neighbourhood plan that reflect their priorities, deliver tangible local benefits and have real weight in planning decisions. Neighbourhood planning was introduced in 2011 through the Localism Act and local examples include [East Shoreditch](https://www.eastshoreditchforum.org.uk/) and [Isle of Dogs](https://www.isleofdogsforum.org.uk/).

Neighbourhood Plans are developed and delivered by a Neighbourhood Forum. Forums are made up of people who live or work in the area. It's important to have as many people involved in the Forum as possible in order to ensure policies represent the views of the whole community. The Forum is seeking representatives from local businesses, community groups, places of worship, charities and resident associations to join the initiative. Find out more about joining the Forum at the [RomanRoadNeighbourhoodPlan.org website](https://www.romanroadbowneighbourhoodplan.org).

Roman Road Trust has enlisted the help of neighbourhood planning specialists Public Works who will offer guidance and advice about setting up a Neighbourhood Plan. Tom Dobson and Andy Belfield from Public Works will be attending Forum meetings over the next few months and helping to set up the Forum's Steering Committee. The Steering Committee currently has vacancies for a Chair, Secretary and Treasure - [find out more about these roles here](https://romanroadbowneighbourhoodplan.org/forum).

Roman Road Trust is a community development trust working on a community-led regeneration of Roman Road involved in several local initiatives including the Roman Road LDN high street digital platforms, Roman Road Festival and the new Roman Road Yard Market.

Tom Dobson and Andy Belfield will be talking at the [Inaugural Public Meeting](https://romanroadbowneighbourhoodplan.org/event/inaugural-public-meeting) on Saturday 20th February to explain the process and open up discussions with the local community. One of the first things to be discussed is where the boundary of the Neighbourhood Plan should be.

If you can't come to the Inaugural Meeting on Saturday 20 February there will be more meetings planned at other times of the week on a monthly basis. [Click here to subscribe to Forum updates.](https://romanroadbowneighbourhoodplan.org/join-forum)
