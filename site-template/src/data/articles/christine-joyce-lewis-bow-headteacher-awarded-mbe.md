Christine Joyce Lewis, the former headteacher of Children’s House Nursery School in Bow, has been awarded an MBE for services to education in the New Year Honours List 2023

The New Year is often when we look ahead to the future with renewed optimism. But it is also a time for reflection and recognition of the great deeds carried out by people across the UK.

The New Year Honours List 2023, the first list to be signed by King Charles III, celebrates the extraordinary achievements of 1,107 people from all walks of life.

Fifty per cent of this year’s honours recipients were women. One of these incredible women was Christine Joyce Lewis.

Lewis was awarded Member of the Order of The British Empire (MBE) for her services to education. Lewis has had a long and distinguished career in education, with a specialism in special educational needs.

Lewis was the headteacher of Children’s House Nursery School in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets from 2007-2021. In its last three inspections, the school has been recognised as “outstanding” by Ofsted. 

In a recent blog post by Children’s House Nursery School, Lewis was described as “much loved” and always being “a wonderful advocate for all children”.

The blog stated that Lewis “would like to share her MBE with the Children’s House staff team, the children, families and local community who she has worked so closely with”.

Beatrice Merrick, Chief Executive of The British Association for Early Childhood Education, was delighted by the awarding of MBEs to Lewis along with several other education practitioners. “We should celebrate all such public recognition of the impact that early years practitioners have on young children’s lives,” says Merrick in Nursery World.
