Capstone Foster Care is calling upon Tower Hamlets residents to give back to the local community and consider fostering.

More children than ever in Tower Hamlets need stable, loving homes to call their own. Capstone Foster Care is an independent fostering agency that prides itself on providing long-term care for some of East London’s most vulnerable young people. One way they do this is through exceptional matching, and finding the right family to suit the needs of the child.

Capstone is looking for foster carers from every sort of background, age, and gender to take up the fostering calling. It is only through having a diverse and unique team of foster carers that they’re able to find the personalised matches and the best long-term homes for children.

So, what are the fundamental fostering criteria you need before considering fostering?

### A spare room

Fostering starts with a spare room, and the most basic step to begin the fostering journey. However, fostering is so much more than a spare room, you need kindness, patience and time to commit to the care of a child.

### Be in good health

Being in good physical and mental health is important, as you will be required to ensure the well-being of a vulnerable young person. However, enquiries are welcome from individuals considered to have a disability as long as you can take care of others. For example, Capstone Foster Care has foster carers who live with visual impairments. Adjustments will be discussed with you to give you the very best support.

### Be over the age of 21

Did you know that there is no upper age limit to foster? It’s a common preconception that you are too old to foster after age fifty. Contrary to that, in the Capstone’s sixteen-year history, the over-fifties age group has proven to be an ideal group to consider fostering, having the life experience, space and time to dedicate to a child. In fact, Capstone Foster Care has foster carers in their seventies still fostering, with no signs of slowing down.

Ready to make a child’s future brighter? Give the Capstone team a call today on 0800 012 4004. Alternatively, visit [Capstonefostercare.co.uk](https://www.capstonefostercare.co.uk/) to find a wealth of information.
