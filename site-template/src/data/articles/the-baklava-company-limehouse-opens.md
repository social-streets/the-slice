The Baklava Company opens in a former Barclays Bank reanimating a landmark building and creating a culinary highlight on Commercial Road.

The Baklava Company has opened a slick new flagship shop on Commercial Road, near [Limehouse Town Hall](https://romanroadlondon.com/sam-valiant-second-generation-bengali-bow-interview/). The shop sells a range of contemporary takes on the traditional dessert, such as Biscoff, Oreo and Nutella flavours.

The Baklava Company was originally on Whitechapel Road near the Royal London but they have now moved to this larger site, offering more seating.

The shop is a welcome addition to the east end of Commercial Road. It is in an old converted bank, with a grand stone facade. And it stands out in contrast to the long-empty old car showroom across the road. 

When I visited, the final touches were still being made. Curious locals were popping in to look at the shop which looks more like a trendy Shoreditch coffee shop than a traditional Turkish dessert shop. 

The light-filled and calm space will appeal to families. There is plenty of seating and room for buggies. 

But it is young people the Baklava Company is trying to appeal to most. To do so they have chosen minimalist design and photogenic desserts, along with savvy social media promotion. A recent giveaway promoted through TikTok led to queues around the block.

Open daily from 11 am to 11 pm, the store is part of a growing trend of dessert shops and baklava specialists, including the recently opened [Mehmet Efendi 1953](https://whitechapellondon.co.uk/mehmet-efendi-1953-turkish-tea-cake-baklava-shop-aldgate/). 

The shop serves a range of other sweet treats, such as waffles, künefe and a speciality baklava ice cream sandwich. They also serve non-alcoholic mojitos and milkshakes.

The Baklava Company’s new Limehouse shop would make a great end to a long weekend canal walk from Vicky Park to the Limehouse basin.
