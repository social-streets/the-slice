Poplar Union welcomes SHEWOLVES, a new play about teenage activism, climate change, and female empowerment.

Ever thought you should run the world, even though you’re “only fourteen and a girl”? 

SHEWOLVES, a brand new play all about teenage climate activism arrives at [Poplar Union](https://poplarunion.com/) this May. It tells the story of Priya and Lou, two girls who head into the wilderness on a mission to tackle climate change.

Starring Gurjot Dhaliwal as Priya and Harriet Waters as Lou, SHEWOLVES explores the power of hope, the complexities of friendship, and the smartness of teens, as the two friends set out to make their voices heard. 

Aimed at audiences of 12 and above, the play arrives in Poplar as part of a tour of UK theatres before a run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this summer. 

‘I hope it leaves audiences laughing, punching the air and feeling empowered to speak up’ said playwright Sarah Middleton. ‘This is a play for anyone who’s ever gatecrashed a sleepover or forgotten to pack the loo roll. It’s about sisterhood, protest and Pop-Tarts.’

Emma Dunstan, director of programming at Poplar Union, was thrilled to welcome the production. “The play is an incredible piece of new writing, exploring activism through the eyes of two young women. It's a powerful piece about female empowerment, the complexities of friendship and how to get your voice heard about things you care about.”

The play was created by [WE ARE SHEWOLVES](https://www.weareshewolves.co.uk/), a creative project supported by the Arts Council England that aims to amplify the voices of young women. Through poetry, theatre and zine workshops, they help young women use their creativity to speak out about issues that matter to them. 

SHEWOLVES runs at Poplar Union on Sunday 1st May, with tickets on sale now.
