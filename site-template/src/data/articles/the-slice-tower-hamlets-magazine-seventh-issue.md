The Slice’s seventh issue celebrates the East End’s role in pioneering British street photographing past, present and future and is packed full of ideas on how to get the most out of your borough this autumn and winter.

The seventh edition of The Slice, Tower Hamlets’ only free independent magazine, is now available at stockists across the borough. This issue showcases local greats of street photography and features content from our family of community news titles,  [Roman Road LDN](https://romanroadlondon.com/), [Bethnal Green LDN](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/), [Whitechapel LDN](https://whitechapellondon.co.uk/) and [Poplar LDN](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/).

As a social enterprise, The Slice Tower Hamlets uses journalism to tell our communities’ important stories. 

The seventh edition pays homage to photographers who have snapped the many facets of our complex, always intriguing borough. Features range from ‘riot photographer’ David Hoffman’s photos of squatted Whitechapel, to Paul Trevor’s theatrical street markets, to the queer sex worker scene snapped by Poppy Pray. David Hoffman's photo of a young girl in Whitechapel is our cover image.

Editor-in-chief Tabitha Stapely said: ‘In the field of journalism, we work to uncover the truth and disprove the false. Photojournalism has always been a vital tool in this mission. It corroborates a story, bears witness to experience, and provides additional context that would otherwise take a thousand words to convey.’

In addition, issue seven features reporting on changing education patterns for third-generation Bengalis in Whitechapel. And in Poplar, the unlikely history of the Cold War’s pivotal chess match and well as an interview with local Ukranian refugee Luba Lukhanina. 

You’ll also find an events guide to get you through the winter, an especially action-packed news in review and a high street guide with hidden gems and established classics.

The Slice print magazine is free because we believe quality local journalism should be freely available to all. As a not-for-profit social enterprise, we rely on small monthly donations from readers and local businesses to fund our work. We want to be accountable to our community, not to outside sponsors – [please consider signing up to keep The Slice coming.](https://romanroadlondon.com/membership/)
