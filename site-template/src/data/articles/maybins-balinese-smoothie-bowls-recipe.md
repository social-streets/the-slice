[Maybin’s](https://romanroadlondon.com/best-brunch-bow-mile-end-globe-town/) has had a Bali-inspired makeover since Carly came back to the Roman Road from travelling. As promised, we’re bringing you Carly's recipes for her healthy smoothie bowls.

‘Super-charged with goodness, our vitality bowls are the new breakfast trend everyone is whizzing up. Inspired by Bali, they get your taste buds buzzing and give you a nutritional health kick to your morning. Get that vitamin C boost you need to rev up your immune system after a hard weekend.

‘Along with the fact they are filled to the brim with antioxidants, the smoothie bowls also have superfood ingredients which are incredibly high in protein and B-vitamins. For fussy eaters, there are dairy free options, gluten free (without the granola). Or perhaps for you classic meat eaters, it’s a change from the morning fry up or a bacon sarnie.

‘We have two delicious and refreshing bowls currently on the menu: the Lady Gaga ‘Bright Pink in colour’ and the Green Peace ‘You know it’s the good stuff when it’s green’.'

## The Lady Gaga

#### Ingredients

1 banana  
Half a mango  
5 strawberries  
Half a passion fruit  
2 squeezed oranges  
1 handful of ice

#### Recipe

Blend the banana, mango, three of the strawberries and the orange in a food mixer. Put in the base of the bowl, surrounded by the granola and ice. Decorate with the passion fruit and the remaining strawberries, and enjoy!

## Green Peace

#### Ingredients

1 banana  
Handful of spinach  
Half a mango  
2 slices of pineapple  
1 tbsp of spirulina  
4 strawberry slices (for the topping)  
1 handful of granola

#### Recipe

Put the banana, spinach, pineapple, mango and spirulina in a food mixer and blend. Put it in your favourite breakfast bowl with ice and granola, and top with strawberry slices.
