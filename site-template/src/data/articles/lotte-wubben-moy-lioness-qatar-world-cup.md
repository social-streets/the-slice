Lionesses centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy who grew up on Zealand Road, Bow East, has said she will be supporting the England team but won’t be watching the men’s football World Cup in Qatar due to the country’s views on women, homosexuality and human rights.

[Wubben-Moy](https://romanroadlondon.com/lotte-wubben-moy-footballer-interview/), who attended Olga Primary School and is a role model for local girls, has been a vocal advocate for equality and has campaigned for equal access to football in schools.

She said: It’s tough … As an England team we all have strong values and a lot of those values aren’t reflected, in the way that we see it, in Qatar.

‘Sport is a very strong vehicle for change. To underestimate that would be naive. I’ve seen a lot of the players have strong viewpoints and I salute them, and I wish them the best in looking to express that throughout this World Cup.’

‘A lot of the players might not ever play in a World Cup again, so I can’t comment on them choosing to go because many people would make that same choice. But \[if\] they can use this opportunity to help bring about change, I think that’s important.’
