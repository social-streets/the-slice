From traditional East End boozers to trendy gastro pubs, Roman Road and the surrounding areas offer a pub to suit every patron. We've curated a guide to the best pubs in the area so that you know exactly where to head at the end of the week.

## **The Eleanor Arms**

BEST FOR: A QUIRKY NIGHT OUT

![Eleanor Arms pub on Old Ford Road](/images/Elenoar-arms-pub-old-ford-road-1024x713-1-1024x713.jpg)

A local favourite that stood out to us is [The Eleanor Arms](https://romanroadlondon.com/eleanor-arms-pub/). Real ale lovers will be pleased to hear this is a CAMRA pub with matching real pub decor.

Owner Frankie brings his own idiosyncratic twist to pub shenanigans including the infamous Minestrone of Sound every Friday and Saturday. The music played comes from Frankie's ‘wedding floor fillers’ from his CD collection. There is also live jazz every Sunday night from 8 pm (free entry) and a monthly charity quiz on the first Thursday of the Month.

Round the back is a pool table and if you ask Frankie he will bring out his large selection of board games, cards and ‘shut the box’.

They have been in the CAMRA Good Beer guide since 2009 and also feature in a Danish London Pub guide as the number one pub in London.

_You can find the Eleanor Arms at 460 Old Ford Road, E3 5JP_

## **Lord Tredegar**

BEST FOR: A SUNDAY ROAST

![Exterior of Lord Tredegar pub Lichfield Road](/images/Lord-Tredegar-1024x656-1-1024x656.jpg)

Named after the eccentric Welsh Lord responsible for building much of Bow in the late 1800s, The [Lord Tredegar](https://remarkablepubs.co.uk/pubs/lord-tredegar/) is pronounced tred-ee-gar.

Every Sunday the pub serves delicious roasts that have proved very popular amongst locals. You can choose from cauliflower cheese, seed roast, braised pork belly, pan-fried chicken, sirloin beef, or lamb shank.

The tap beers change regularly, and they try to support local breweries as much as possible including one in Mile End, Hackney, and Beavertown. There is also a large beer garden for the summer so you can enjoy some sunshine with your drink

_You can find The Lord Tredegar at 50 Lichfield Road, E3 5AL_

## **The Coborn**

BEST FOR: BEAUTIFUL INTERIORS

![the interior of a pub with a large house plant to the left, wood pannelled walls and a small chandelier in The Coborn, Mile End, East London](/images/inside-coborn-mile-end-refurbished.jpg)

Last year, The Coborn underwent some impressive [renovations](https://romanroadlondon.com/coborn-pub-mile-end-reopens/). The Coborn team chose to put in new mahogany-panelled walls and leather button-back chairs which breathed new life into the space.

The pub is a great option for foodies, or anyone who wants to enjoy a glass of wine with a more refined version of a pub classic such as fish and chips. They also serve a Coborn pie and mash which is a classic East End pie that is home-made using West Country beef rump minced in-house.

The Coborn got its name simply from the fact that it is nestled in the middle of Coborn Road. However, reminders of Charles Coborn, the famous music hall singer, are dotted around the pub Born in 1852 in Stepney, Coborn adopted his name from Coborn Road.

_You can find The Coborn at 8 Coborn Road, E3 2DA_

## **Lord Morpeth**

BEST FOR: CREATIVE PIZZAS

![Large sepia tone mural of Sylvia Pankhurst and the Suffragettes on the side of the Lord Morpeth public house in Bow](/images/Sylvia-Pankhurst-street-art-painting-Lord-Morpeth-Bow-web.jpg)

The friendly bar staff, Suffragettes mural and delicious sourdough pizzas at the [Lord Morpeth](https://www.lordmorpeth.co.uk/) make this a very popular pub in the area.

Every Wednesday from 8 pm, Lord Morpeth host a quiz night called The Big Fat Quiz with a £50 bar tab as a jackpot. On Saturdays things turn more musical and from 5 pm there is a weekly DJ set.

Accompany your drink with a delicious sourdough pizza. Try the 'Gordon Bennet’ pizza with salt beef, pickled gherkins, sweet mustard dressing and crispy shallots.

The pub was a local hangout for Sylvia Pankhurst and the East London Suffragette Movement and this heritage has been memorialised on the side of the pub with a mural that references the important work of the suffragettes in a street art style.

_For Lord Morpeth, go to 402 Old Ford Road, E3 5NR_

## **Morgan Arms**

BEST FOR: SOME UNPRETENTIOUS PUB GRUB

Just off the elegant Tredegar Square, the [Morgan Arms](https://www.morganarmsbow.com/) is popular for its tasty food, served in generous portions, and its general lack of pretension. They also have a private drinks area for up to 20 guests, so you can host a cosy birthday get-together in peace.

Perfect for people on a plant-based diet is the vegan Wellington, served on a Sunday as part of their roast menu. If you fancy something a bit meatier, try the Roast chicken which comes with sage and onion stuffing and pigs in blankets.

This pub is unrecognisable from its days when the Kray twins frequented it. Morgan Arms is now a friendly and respectable place to grab a pint. There is also a secret garden perfect for catching the afternoon sun.

## **The Green Goose**

BEST FOR: STEAK

The [Green Goose](https://www.greengooselondon.com/) had a tasteful facelift in 2016, restoring its architectural features and adding fashionable green leather booths.

The pub is named after the historic Green Goose Fair of the 18th and 19th century. The original fair was all about booze, debauchery and eating the geese from the surrounding marshes of East London. 

Every Thursday you can get a £35 steak night for two which includes a bottle of Le Bosq Rouge and a 400g onglet steak to share.

_The Green Goose can be found at 112 Anglo Road, E3 5HD_

## **The Young Prince**

BEST FOR: TRADITIONAL EAST END PUB

![Outside the Young Prince pub on Roman Road](/images/Outside-the-Young-Prince-pub-on-Roman-Road-1024x683.jpg)

Not many people even notice the [Young Prince](https://www.facebook.com/YoungPrinceBeerGarden/) nestled right in the centre of Roman Road, near Thompson’s hardware store. Recently Miles Kane released a [music video](https://romanroadlondon.com/miles-kane-releases-troubled-son-music-video-young-prince-pub/) filmed in the pub in which he is shown playing darts, greeting friends, and being served by local landlord Barry Holloway. .

This dimly lit, cosy pub is stuffed with old photographs, stag heads, trophies and framed fish. It is Bow’s most traditional boozer.

Serving beer from dimpled mugs with a side of traditional pub snacks (think scratchings), this is a place that will satisfy your ‘proper pub’ craving.

There is also a [beer garden](https://romanroadlondon.com/best-beer-gardens/) filled with bright begonias and geraniums that provides a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the high street.

_The Young Prince can be found at 448 Roman Rd, E3 5LU_

## **Rusty Bike**

![Outside the Rusty Bike on Mile End Road](/images/rusty-bike-1024x575.jpg)

Located near Mile End Underground, the spacious Rusty Bike pub offers a friendly and relaxed environment. They also welcome dogs so are a great place to stop at while walking your dog.

The light and airy interior has a rustic feel about it with a modern twist. Alongside traditional pub staples of beer and live sports, Rusty Bike feature an assortment of Thai favourites, including curries, Pad Thai and satay chicken.

_The Rusty Bike can be found at 588 Mile End Rd, Mile End, London E3 4PH_

## **The Palm Tree**

BEST FOR: TREE-LINED SETTING

![Santander Boris Bikes on the grass outside the Palm Tree pub beer garden in East London](/images/The-palm-tree-1024x767.jpg)

Grab a pint from this traditional [East End boozer](https://romanroadlondon.com/last-crooners-palm-tree-pub-tom-oldham/) and lie in the sun next to the water. This pub is ideally located in Mile End park near Regent's Canal and they have a lovely canal-side drinking area. You might be surprised to find the pub surrounded by trees but this is because most of the buildings that were once on this street were bombed during World War Two.

Whether you want to enjoy their classic pub interiors or the surrounding nature, The Palm Tree is a good bet. They also host jazz days so if you enjoy live jazz, The Palm Tree is the place to be.

_The Palm Tree can be found at 127 Grove Road, E3 5RP_

## **The Camel**

BEST FOR: GOURMET PIE AND MASH

![Exterior of The Camel Pub in Globe Town](/images/the-camel-pub-1024x683-1-1024x683.jpg)

Watch the world go by from the picnic benches outside The Camel on Sugar Loaf Walk or enjoy their cosy Victorian interior. This space was once used as a wartime community centre for evacuated children. Today, it's a place for a pint and a pie.

They have a great array of pies that are served between 12:30 pm and 9 pm daily. They range from a Thai green curry pie to a more traditional West Country pork and cider pie.
