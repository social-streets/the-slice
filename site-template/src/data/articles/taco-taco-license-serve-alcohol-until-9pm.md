Mexican restaurant, Taco Taco in Shoreditch gains approval to serve alcohol until 9 pm daily, despite residents' concerns over noise and smells

A Mexican restaurant in Shoreditch will be able to serve alcohol to customers until 9 pm every day following council approval last week.

Taco Taco, which first opened on Commercial Street over a year ago, has been granted a new premises licence by Tower Hamlets Council which will allow the restaurant to sell alcohol from 12 pm to 9 pm every day of the week.

During a meeting with the council’s licensing sub-committee on September 24, Damien Aiudi from Taco Taco said the restaurant wasn’t 'an alcohol-led venue' and said the sale of booze was to complement the dining experience.

The venue is located within a CIA (Cumulative Impact Assessment) zone, meaning Brick Lane has been identified as a problematic area due to the number, type or volume of premises having a negative impact on the four licensing objectives; public safety, public nuisance, crime and disorder and the protection of children from harm.

Because of this, Mr Aiudi had to demonstrate why the council should grant a new licence and guarantee that it wouldn’t negatively impact Brick Lane’s CIA zone.

Some residents had objected to the plans over noise concerns and complained about 'strong cooking smells' and said there were several designated drinking places in the area already.

One resident said: 'I live directly above the premises and already suffer strong cooking smells throughout the day and late into the evening, and noise from thumping, loud music played until 9 pm.

'Once I entered Taco Taco, thinking I should at least try the food, but was shocked at how loud the music was when inside the premises – no wonder it disturbs me in my flat.'

No residents attended last week’s meeting but Mr Aiudi addressed their concerns in the meeting.

  
He said: 'We recognise the importance of the Brick Lane Special Cumulative Impact Policy and the concerns raised by local residents regarding the potential for increased noise, anti-social behaviour (ASB) and public nuisance.

'We understand that noise has been a central issue in objections. To mitigate this we are committed to controlling the volume of any background music within our premises and ensuring that doors and windows remain closed during operating hours to contain sound.'

Mr Aiudi went on to say the restaurant had a seating capacity of 18 people and was a small venue so would have a minimal impact on the area.

He added: 'We believe we have taken every reasonable step to mitigate concerns raised by the objectors; we are committed to operating in a way that enhances the local community rather than to transform it and we believe our application reflects this commitment.

'Our commitment to close by 9 pm further ensures that there is no risk of ASB, distinguishing us from late-night bars and pubs in the area. We are committed to operating within the rules and addressing any past issues raised by the residents such as noise and smells.'

After the meeting, the council’s licensing sub-committee retired to make their decision in private.

A decision later published on the council’s website revealed the committee had granted the new licence, explaining that Mr Aiudi had 'recognised the importance' of the Brick Lane CIA.

Taco Taco is open every day from 11.30 am until 9 pm.
