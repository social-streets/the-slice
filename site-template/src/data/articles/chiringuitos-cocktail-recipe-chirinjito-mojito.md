Strong white rum, lime juice, cane sugar, soda and everyone loves a bit of mint too. The Mojito is one of the most popular cocktails on the planet, perhaps thanks to its refreshing taste that evokes memories of hot summer days. In some cases the traditional and easy-to-make cocktail provides a great inspiration for the creation of new, original potions. Chiringuito, the Spanish beach-bar that opened this summer in Museum Gardens has already won the hearts of many.

Dehayen, the owner of the bar, has worked extremely hard to bring a piece of Barcelona to London, with a rooftop terrace overlooking the lush gardens, tropical drinks and menu inspired by Peruvian cuisine. Their signature cocktail Chirinjito is a playful twist on the Mojito, heightened with a lick of Hibiscus Syrup and a splash of Cava.

#### Ingredients

- 50ml White Rum (We use El Dorado 3 year old)
- 25ml Fresh Lime Juice
- 25ml Hibiscus Syrup\*
- 8 Mint Leaves, slapped
- 50ml Cava (We use Perelada Brut)

1. Add all ingredients aside from Cava to a tall glass
2. Add crushed ice to 3/4 fill glass and churn vigorously to chill.
3. Top with crushed ice and the Cava.
4. Garnish with a Paper Straw, a Mint Sprig and a Dried Hibiscus Flower.

#### \*Chiringuito's Hibiscus Syrup:

100ml Hot Water

100gm Caster Sugar

4 Dried Hibiscus Flowers (available from Health food stores)
