Plans to move the Chinese embassy from Marylebone have been resubmitted for the second time after being previously blocked by Tower Hamlets Council.

Plans to move the Chinese embassy to a site in Tower Hamlets have been called in and will ultimately be decided upon by the Government. Previous plans were unanimously blocked by Tower Hamlets councillors in December 2022, who cited safety concerns for residents and it being minutes away from the [Tower of London, a UNESCO world heritage site.](https://whitechapellondon.co.uk/historic-england-office-blocks-impact-tower-london-heritage-site/)

China, which currently has its embassy in Portland Place, Marylebone in the City of Westminster, never appealed the previous rejection however an identical planning application was resubmitted to the council’s planning portal in July 2024. The plans were called-in on behalf of the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Angela Rayner on October 14, with a public inquiry expected to start at the end of January next year.

An appointed inspector will hold the public inquiry, followed by a report and recommendation for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) and the Secretary of State who will make the final decision. The Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) understands the plans have been called in by the Government as it raises issues beyond ‘local importance’ and could have an effect on other governments or have impacts on national security.

The Chinese government purchased Royal Mint Court, which is located close to Tower Bridge, for £255 million in May 2018. The Chinese embassy argues previous reasons for refusal were ‘without merit’ and ‘have no basis in planning policy’. The latest plans, which are the same as those submitted in June 2021, would see some of the Grade II listed buildings partially bulldozed, while others would be refurbished and restored.

The site, which covers over 5 acres of land and has reportedly been empty since 2013, would also have accommodation for diplomats, offices and a new visa office and cultural exchange building. Both the planning and listed building applications have been called in by the Government.

An MHCLG spokesperson said: 'Applications for a new Chinese embassy in Tower Hamlets have been called in for ministers to decide. A final decision will be made in due course.'

Previous plans received 51 objections, which included letters from residents’ groups living at St Mary Grace’s Court, Royal Mint Estate, St Katharine Docks as well as representatives from Tower Hamlets Homes.

Residents raised fears that the site could be ‘turned into a fortress and would be a terrorist target’ and had concerns that protesters would be demonstrating on their streets as well as there being increased CCTV. Previous plans were rejected following an intense meeting with the council’s Strategic Development Committee which lasted for almost three hours and was attended by Uyghur and human rights activists.

A spokesperson for the council said: 'We’re aware that both planning and listed building applications have been called in by the Secretary of State. A local inquiry will take place to determine the applications as opposed to the decision being made by Tower Hamlets. This is expected to commence in the last week of January. Our Strategic Development Committee will be asked to consider a report in due course to agree our position for the purpose of the local inquiry.'

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy previously said: 'Six years ago, the Chinese government purchased the Royal Mint Court for the use as the new Chinese embassy premises. The UK Government had given its consent to this. Now we are in the process of applying for planning permission. The resubmitted planning application has taken into full consideration the UK’s planning policy and guidance as well as the opinions of all relevant parties. This is a high-quality development scheme.'

They added: 'The Chinese embassy in the UK is committed to promoting the friendship between the Chinese and British people and the development of bilateral relations between the two countries. Building the new embassy at an early date would help us better perform such responsibilities.

'Host countries have the international obligation to support and facilitate the building of the premises of diplomatic missions. Both China and the UK have the need to build a new embassy in each other’s capital, and the two sides should provide facilitation to each other.'
