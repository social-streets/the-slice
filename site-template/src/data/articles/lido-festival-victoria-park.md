We deep dive into AEG's second two-weekender festival in Victoria Park – who is playing, ticket prices, stage times and more.

LIDO Festival have confirmed the line-up with headliner Jamie xx and a weekend brat summer takeover from Charli XCX.

From June 7, Victoria Park will be home to the new two-weekend festival with one main stage towards the left and two smaller stages on the right side of the park. 

Jamie xx is the first headlining act at LIDO and has curated his line-up of artists for the festival. Jamie xx is a member of The xx, a band known for producing minimalist indie pop that blends elements of electronic music, soft vocals, and guitar tones.

'I’m really looking forward to headlining Victoria Park, curating my own day festival and performing alongside my favourite artists.’ said Jamie xx. 

June 14 will start the second weekend with Charli XCX bringing a ‘Party Girl’ line-up to LIDO Festival, her first UK festival as a headliner. 

Her line-up will be filled with collaborators from her album Brat which went viral for its lime green album cover, coining the term ‘having a Brat Summer’ and landed at number 1 on the UK Official Album Chart in October. 

More headliners, complete line-ups, and full programs are yet to be announced.

Ticket types include VIP Garden and VIP Pit options which will give people more exclusivity at the festival. Tickets go on general sale on Friday, November 29.

The first weekend of the festival starts on June 7 with Jamie xx headlining the main stage at 2 pm. 

Jamie’s line-up includes fellow band member Romy Madley Croft and many collaborators on his latest album including, Arca, Sampha, Panda Bear, and Hackney-based rapper John Glacier. The line-up also features several DJs including DJ Gigolo, Shy One, Wookie, Livwutang, and DJ Harvey who will perform a 3-hour set list at LIDO.

The second weekend will be a party girl festival with a set list curated by Charli XCX. 

Charli’s music blends mainstream pop with avant-garde elements and has a cultural icon with her album Brat and her party girl DJ campaign causing roadblocks around the world. 

Guest stars on the day will include Brat collaborators Bladee, The Japanese House, and The Dare, as well as 070 Shake, Kelly Lee Owens and A. G. Cook. It wouldn’t come as a surprise if Charli XCX brought out surprise guests on the day which will be a treat for those who attend. 

## What makes LIDO different to All Points East? 

At the moment, not much. The initial line-up for LIDO’s first weekend features several artists who have previously performed at All Points East. 

In fact, five out of the nine acts, including John Glacier and Shy One—both of whom played there last year—have appeared on past All Points East line-ups.

This isn't too promising for those looking for something different to the festival that has been in Victoria Park for the past seven years. 

The announcement of Charli XCX as the second headliner has increased interest in LIDO, as this marks her first UK festival as a curator. Given her history of sell-out shows and her viral Brat album, her involvement has pushed the festival into a more mainstream category. 

Another famous artist RAYE, is one of this year's headliners at All Points East, also giving the festival more mainstream attention. 

However, both line-ups feature a blend of indie and emerging artists alongside well-known, established acts, giving both festivals a similar balance between fresh talent and recognisable names.

AEG organises both festivals, which is why ticketing information and VIP layouts might seem familiar. These familiar features of the LIDO festival raise concerns that it might end up feeling like a replica of All Points East.

However, it does provide a chance for those unable to get tickets to one festival to try attending the other. 

The midweek programme is set to provide free arts, culture and well-being activities with details not yet announced.

LIDO Festival has a partnership with East London Arts and Music (ELAM) which aims to provide students with hands-on experience in the creative industry. The partnership allows aspiring students the chance to perform and have opportunities in festival production and technology. 

Based in Bomley-by-Brow, ELAM is a full Industry Academy for 16-19-year-olds wanting to pursue a career in Music, Film and Television production and game design.

This collaboration will bring new artists into the limelight for the first time but is nothing new for AEG. 

AEG have made ELAM a festival partner in the past for All Points East in which students had exclusive access to music professionals to learn the ins and outs of producing a successful show. 

All Points East have an In Your Neighbourhood free midweek programme with a range of activities from dance, to children's entertainment and music performances. The programme is full of local vendors and businesses but unfortunately doesn’t see a high attendance. 

We will have to wait and see if LIDO’s midweek programme and involvement with ELAM will draw more people to Victoria Park.

## What will each ticket cost you and how much will it cost you?
