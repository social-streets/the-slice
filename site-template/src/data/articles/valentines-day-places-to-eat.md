While Valentine’s Day 2021 was something of a damp squib, our local bars and restaurants worked hard to offer takeaway treats and ensured that love still flourished during lockdown. But, this year will be different. 

With restaurant tables laid out, cafés’ roasteries warming up the coffee beans, and cocktail glasses gleaming, there is no excuse; 2022 is the year to pull out all the stops and celebrate in style with the ones you love.

With not long to go to woo your date, amp up the romance with your partner, or even just show a friend how much you love them, we’ve got you covered on some of the best places to go for a cosy coffee and cake or a romantic dinner to spoil your loved one.

## **Barge East**

Where could be more romantic than spending the day dedicated to love than on a century’s old barge, bedecked with twinkling lights like stars, moored on the canal? If this sounds up your street (or canal) then head to Barge East for its Valentine’s Evening special. For £49pp, you and your plus one can enjoy a four-course meal (meat and vegan options available), plus a cocktail on arrival, all under the ambiance of rustic decor and dim lighting. Now that’s amore.

## **Cornerstone**

If you want to go all out and treat your partner big time, then it has to be Michelin star winning Cornerstone. This Valentine’s Day, [Cornerstone](https://www.cornerstonehackney.com/), for both lunch and dinner sittings, is offering an eight-course tasting menu to share at £65, or a premium tasting menu to share at £130. The menu changes daily so who knows what you’ll be served?! But, like Valentine’s dates, that’s part of the allure. And, for another Michelin Star call-out, there is Da Terra over in Bethnal Green. Head there for a Brazilian Italian fusion.

Valentine’s Day isn’t all about the candlelit dinners, evening drinks and smooth late-night jazz music. The effortlessly cool cosy living room vibe that’s Mae + Harvey is welcoming its customers for a Valentine’s Day Brunch. Start off the day with pancakes stacked high, topped with rhubarb, flaked almonds and maple syrup. And, even better, it is two for one on cocktails - try Mae + Harvey’s blood orange mimosa to get the heart racing.
