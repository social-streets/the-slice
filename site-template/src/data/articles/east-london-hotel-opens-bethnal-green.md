A brand new hotel is coming to our East End this autumn. The East London Hotel opens in October, and will add a cheap and chic option to [our choice of local places to stays in East London](https://romanroadlondon.com/best-places-to-stay/).

[The East London Hotel](https://www.theeastlondonhotel.com/) has been in the making since 2011, when Definition Capital bought the plot where the Balls Brothers Wine Merchant HQ used to stand. After years of planning and designing, construction finally started in September 2016. So far, the hotel investment value stands at £38 million.

Unlike corporate, cookie-cutter hotels, this medium-sized hotel (it has 161 bedrooms) wants to try and become a useful part of the local community and economy. A spokesperson for The East London Hotel explained ‘The buzzing East End community is what attracted us to Bethnal Green in the first place. While East London has become synonymous with Shoreditch, for us, this is the beating heart of the real East London.'

Working with local businesses, including restaurants and bars, is an important part of The East London Hotel’s plan to become part of the community. Details aren’t finalised yet, but part of their opening package will include partnerships with local businesses.

Tours around the local area will be available for guests, and the hotel build itself, although not quite finished, will have a traditional East End feel. The art hanging in the hotel is predominately that of local artists. 'It is hugely important for us to be a place that truly feels part of the community and is welcoming to both locals and visitors alike'.

Occa Design, a Glaswegian interior design company, were recruited to do the interiors. They say 'The concept for The East London Hotel perfectly balances the heritage of the area with progressive contemporary design, unifying the transient nature of "the hotel" with the immediate neighbourhood and strong sense of local identity.'

The hotel will feature a restaurant and relaxed cafe/bar where guests and visitors alike can spend time. A twin or double room costs from £85 per night. Roll on Autumn.
