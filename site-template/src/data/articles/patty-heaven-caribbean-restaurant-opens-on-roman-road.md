Patty Heaven is bringing Caribbean food back to the Roman. Much needed and a long time coming, the culinary cravings on Roman Road are now satisfied with dumplings, jerk chicken, ackee and saltfish patties, and curry chicken. Sitting between The Albert pub and La Table des Saveurs, Patty Heaven opened on 11 January, and plans to stay.

A family-business, the Caribbean takeaway restaurant is small but growing, and is already popular amongst locals. The bright design and yellow exterior is not the only part of Patty Heaven to stand out.  'We had a dream to make unique blends, and give people something different’ owner Carl Robinson told us. 'The Caribbean restaurant is the only one of its kind on Roman Road'.

Patty Heaven focus on giving 'food cooked with a twist,' with their lobster patties, and their desire to make and add flavours as they become more settled. Their new menus are on the way and there will also be some more homemade cakes under the glass like banana cake, carrot cake and peanut cake.

‘I’d recommend the saltfish fritters or curry goat’ Robinson told us, as they are the most popular dishes since the opening. The owners have visited many of the other cafes along the Roman and have received ‘warm encouragement’ in what they’re doing.

They have a broad breakfast menu with cornmeal, banana, and peanut porridge as well as snacks like callalo and dumplings. Finally, there is a lunchtime special for curry chicken and stew chicken, being just £3.50.  You can find your lunch at 504 Roman Rd, London E3 5LU, the site of the old 504 Roman Road gallery.

_Other cafes have opened or been refurbished in the area too. Read about the [new Hub opening in Victoria Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/new-hub-cafe-opens-victoria-park/) and the [refurbishment at Cafe East](https://romanroadlondon.com/cafe-east-reopens-after-refurb/)_
