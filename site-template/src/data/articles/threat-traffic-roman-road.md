## **Traffic on Roman Road**

You might have seen the Barclays Cycle Superhighway plans from Transport for London to install much safer cycling lanes along the length of Whitechapel Road/Mile End Road/Bow Road from Aldgate to Bow Roundabout. With so many cyclists having been killed or injured along this route, this can only be a good thing.

However, we are concerned around one of the proposals in Bow, and its possible impact on the Roman Road.

Section Five of the Barclays Cycle Superhighway plan includes a proposal for the Mile End Road/Grove Road/Burdett Road junction that would ban all right turns from Burdett Road onto Mile End Road. We are really worried that the effect of this will be that lots of cars will end up travelling up Grove Road and turning right onto Roman Road to continue their journey eastwards, either heading to the A12 or back through residential streets to the Bow Road.

Traffic on the Roman Road can already be awful at peak times, making it a much less pleasant place to be. We don't want to increase the traffic even more.

Cyclist groups aren't happy with the proposed ban here: both Tower Hamlets Wheelers and the London Cycling Campaign are opposing it, as pushing traffic into residential streets is only likely to increase problems for cyclists.

## **Have your say**
