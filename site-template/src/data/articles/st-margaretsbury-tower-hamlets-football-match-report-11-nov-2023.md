Tower Hamlets emerge victorious in fiercely contested mid-table clash versus St Margaretsbury.

### Match Facts:

Date - 11/11/23, KO. @15.00

Location - The Recreation Ground

### Game Overview:

Following a well-earned 2-2 draw against East London rivals Clapton on Wednesday 8 November, Tower Hamlets took a trip to Hertfordshire where they played 18th place St Margaretsbury. 

It was a poor footballing performance from both clubs in the first half as the ball spent more time in the air than it did on the ground. Tower Hamlets (playing in yellow and black) found most of their success off the flanks with both Honesty and Igbuya firing off shots on target in the first 20. Nonetheless, St Margaretsbury battled back. Number 7 for the reds played a feisty role on the right wing - winning a number of free kicks with his cheeky attitude and quick feet.

0-0 in the 40th as the team talks were being prepared by both sets of management - tactics drawn up at any attempt to find a way through. In the dugout for Tower Hamlets on Saturday were Sian Fitzpatrick and Lucia Abbate. Sian Fitzpatrick, the current manager and head coach of Millwall Lionesses Academy and Lucia Abbate a coach at MK Dons - were sure to make something happen for Tower Hamlets at halftime. 

However, this all went out the window as left back (number 3) for St Margaretsbury converted a penalty, after the kick was given for a handball against Tower Hamlets.

Making it 1-0 to home side St Margaretsbury going into the break.

A double substitution at halftime proved crucial for Tower Hamlets as Conor French and Leon Lewis came on for David Igbuya and Stand-Aldridge. 

Following a pinpoint pass out to the right from Tower Hamlets midfielder Nas Crespo, Solly Asomah linked up with new-man Conor French, to find a toe-punted shot off the far post converted past the St Margaretsbury number 1. Solly pegged the East London side back to 1-1.

A gripping last 20 minutes saw 2 red cards - 1 for each club, all amongst another goal for Tower Hamlets. Following an assist from substitute Conor French, it was now fellow substitution Lewis' turn to make an impact. A combative defensive performance was topped off with a volleyed goal. Lewis watched the ball poorly cleared by St Margaretsbury fall to him on the edge of the box where he drilled the ball through traffic bouncing off the goalkeeper and skillfully found the back of the net.

Tower Hamlets' resolute defending saw them come out victorious. At last, it was a comeback for them to shout about. One that will give them confidence in next week’s away game against bottom-of-the-league, Park View.
