Gotto Trattoria is a family run restaurant on the banks of the River Lea at Here East, just a half an hour walk from Roman Road along the canal. Their recipe for family favourite Paccheri All'Amatriciana (or in English, pasta with bacon and onion) is satisfying and simple to make.

#### Ingredients

150g Paccheri pasta  
80g white onions  
150g guanciale (cured meat)  
300g peeled tomatoes  
1 glass of dry white wine (like Soave)  
Salt and pepper to taste  
10g fresh parsley  
20g Pecorino Romano

#### Preparation

Peel and chop the onions into small pieces.

Chop the guanciale as small as the onions then put everything in a pan with olive oil, on medium heat, then add the white wine glass. Add salt to taste and let it cook for about 10 minutes.  
Take your peeled tomatoes (previously blended) and put it in the pan on low heat, for about 30 minutes or until you see the sauce is reduced.

At this point prepare to cook your pasta.

Bring a fair amount of water (Paccheri are very big pasta!) with salt to boil.

Let the pasta cook for about 15 minutes (see pack) and when you feel that it's still "al dente", pour it in the pan and add some Pecorino Romano, a bit of pepper and freshly chopped parsley.

Let the pasta absorb all the delicious sauce and serve with some more Pecorino on top.
