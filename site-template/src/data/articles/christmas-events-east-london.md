Vincent Hayes is performing his Vincent’s Jinglebell Christmas at Brick Lane Music Hall in Silvertown for one week before Christmas.

The show is a good old-fashioned Christmas performance held in a converted Victorian Church, running throughout the festive period. It will include musicians, singers and dancers performing Christmas songs, jokes and sketches.

The performances will be followed by a three-course Christmas candlelight dinner and an opportunity to dance till midnight. 

Vincent Hayes, founder of Brick Lane Music Hall, transformed St Mark’s church into an entertainment space with a box office, bar and reception area, seating and tables for 180 guests and dressing rooms for performers. Hayes himself will perform in the show alongside his cast. 

The church, regarded as a masterpiece of Victorian Gothic architecture, was neglected during the 1970s and 1980s. It was eventually rescued and restored but remained empty until Hayes’s makeover, which transformed it into a modern theatrical venue while preserving its original design. 

A Grade II\* listing was given to the conversion by English Heritage in 2012 to recognise the care taken by Brick Lane Music Hall to preserve the building’s original vision while creating a space for the community. 

The venue now hosts luncheon shows, matinees with afternoon tea, and evening dinner concerts in the traditional music hall style.

Potted Panto, the West End’s longest-running panto returns to its East End home at Wilton’s Music Hall for the second year running, for the 2024 festive season. 

_Potted Panto,_ puts a twist on what you would expect from traditional panto. It combines seven classic pantomime stories including Aladdin, Cinderella and Dick Whittington. 

The 80-minute performance is a mix of slapstick comedy, sarcasm and manic costume changes. 

The show ran for seven consecutive festive seasons at the Vaudeville and Garrick Theatres, making it the West End’s longest-running panto. 

Creators and best friends Daniel Clarkson and Jefferson Turner star in _Potted Panto and_ previously co-presented CBBC until 2009. The writing and performing duo have four shows under their belt _Potted Potter, Potted Pirates, Potted Sherlock and Potted Panto._ 

The ‘Potted’ stage shows have been successful, earning both audience praise and critical acclaim, having sell-out seasons in the West End and a current Las Vegas residency with their show _‘Potted Potter’._ 

The history of Wilton’s Music Hall goes back to the 1690s when the buildings began as houses, shops and a pub are now home to ticket purchasing, rehearsals and show watching. 

John Wilton built the Victorian Music Hall in 1959 intending to bring the West End glamour and first-rate entertainment to the East End working people. Wilton’s Music Hall is the oldest Grand Music Hall in the world and is home to over 300 performances and over 80 productions every year.

Chisato Minamimura is a deaf performance artist, choreographer and BSL art guide. Minamimura has contributed to aerial performances with Graeae Theatre Company, London’s Paralympic Opening Ceremony 2012 and Rio’s 2016 Paralympic Cultural Olympiad.

Rotimi Fani-Kayode’s photography exhibition _The Studio -Staging Desire_ will be running at Autograph Gallery from October 31 - March 22 2025. 

The exhibition is the culmination of research into the artist’s archives showcasing never-before-seen works that reveal what it meant for Fani-Kayode to negotiate the status of ‘outsider’ amongst London’s, racial multiverse in the 80s. Fani-Kay’s photography has a core focus on cultural politics of difference and has been exhibited internationally since 1985.

Alongside his artistry, he became a founding signatory and one of the first chairs of Autograph, London. 

In the BSL response to the exhibition Minamimura will contextualise Fani-Kayode’s practice with art and activism in the 80s and by using the artist's body of work, she will explore themes of self-representation, spirituality and community from a Deaf perspective. 

Autograph Gallery is a photography-focused gallery dedicated to artists who use photography and film to explore themes of race, representation, human rights, and social justice.

The 45-minute event is an opportunity to learn about the never-before-seen works from Fani-Kayode’s wider practice followed by time to socialise over drinks.

The Felix Project Santa Stair Climb is a festive fundraising stair-climbing challenge in Canary Wharf. 

The fundraiser climb of 1,031 steps across 48 floors was launched last year to help tackle challenges faced due to the cost of living and has returned this year. 

Each climber has a minimum fundraising target of £300 helping raise enough to fund and redistribute 825,000 meals for Londoners in need. Upon entry, a Santa hat, themed t-shirt, and medal will be provided to take home, along with the opportunity to help the community and enjoy views across London once the challenge is conquered. 

The Felix Project helps feed local communities by rescuing fresh and nutritious food that would otherwise be thrown away. 

Food is then delivered to charities and schools by volunteers, ensuring that the most vulnerable individuals in our society have access to healthy meals.

In 2023 the Felix Project rescued 13,394 tonnes of food and gave out the equivalent of 32 million meals. The Project offers many ways to volunteer including at depots, kitchens, markets or events. They are based across London with a Felix Kitchen in Poplar supporting community organisations with readymade meals using surplus food rescued.
