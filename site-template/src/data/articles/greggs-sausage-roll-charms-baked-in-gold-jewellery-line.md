Our favourite Greggs baked goods have been immortalised East End style in 22-carat gold charms, pendants and signet rings

Greggs has announced the launch of its first-ever official jewellery collection, dropping this Friday the 13th of September to sync up with London Fashion Week.

The limited edition range was released after a hint was posted on Greggs’ social channels over the weekend, prompting fans to speculate.  

The launch of ‘Baked in Gold’ will see some of Greggs’ iconic menu items interpreted as wearable, 22-carat gold-plated accessories. The collection is designed by contemporary British artist, Dion Kitson. 

From the classic Sausage Roll Stud Earrings to the Jammy Heart Locket Necklace, Greggs fans will see their favourite snacks re-imagined as jewellery. The collection also includes a signet ring and a charms bracelet. 

It’s great news for loyal patrons of the Roman Road Greggs, whose affordable prices and crispy, golden puff pastries have made the chain branch a neighbourhood staple. [Fans of Jungle Electric’s vegan sausage roll](https://romanroadlondon.com/greggs-jungle-electric-vegan-sausage-roll-taste-test/)s, which are home-made and seasoned with herbs, might have to hold out for an indie jewellery alternative. 

If the popularity of [Delan's boxing glove charms and sovereign gold rings](https://romanroadlondon.com/delan-jewellery-shop-interview/) is anything to go by, we’re sure this range of golden Greggs goods is bound to be seen adorning the most fashionable Roman Roadies.

The link to shop the Baked in Gold collection will be posted on Greggs’ social media channels first thing on Friday 13th September, ahead of a 10 am launch. Purchases are limited to five pieces of jewellery per person.
