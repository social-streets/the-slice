The first weekend of June marks Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee and it's no surprise that the East End is embracing the festivities with gusto.

When Princess Elizabeth (now The Queen) was born in Mayfair 1926, none of her family expected that one day she would become Monarch. But in December 1936, when her uncle Kind Edward WIII abdicated and her father took to the throne, the day would come when she would become The Queen of the United Kingdom. 

The beginning of 1952 saw her father, King George VI, suffering illness, forcing him to abandon a proposed Commonwealth tour. Then, in February 1952, King George VI sadly died, meaning it was finally time for 26 year old Princess Elizabeth to be crowned Queen Elizabeth II. 

Now, seventy years later, the UK  has seen the truly remarkable work The Queen has done for our country. All over the four nations, banners are being prepared, cakes baked, music sheets organised, and chairs counted as the celebration of The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee begins.

But what’s happening here? We have rounded up some of the best local events, fit for a queen, to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II’s seventy-year reign over the UK.

## Street parties and local celebrations

Over the Jubilee weekend, a number of roads in Tower Hamlets are hosting street parties, including **Ridgdale Street, Lichfield Road, and Victoria Park**. Streets will be lined with tables and chairs, for everyone to enjoy some tasty snacks in celebration. There will be a number of competitions taking place, with opportunities to channel your inner Mary Berry or Vincent Van Gogh. These include: best cake; best model of a royal; and, best crown made of waste materials. Not only that, but the local community has collected nearly £500, and will be hosting an open event in Victoria Park with food, snacks, drinks, games, and music for anyone and everyone to enjoy!
