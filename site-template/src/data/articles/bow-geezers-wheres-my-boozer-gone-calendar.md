The OAP _Geezers_ club in E3, aka the _Bow Geezers_, are launching a cheeky nude calendar to raise awareness of disappearing pubs in East London.

In true Calendar Girls style features a nude member of the Geezers club each month enjoying traditional pub pursuits.

While the calendar is guaranteed to raise a smile or three, it's main mission is to raise awareness of the plight of disappearing local boozers.

Over the last 20 years the boys calculate that they have lost a staggering 92 pubs in their local community of Bow, E3 alone. Chief Geezer Ray Gipson says, "It's not just about the booze - we're losing our heritage; the architecture and decor, the traditional games and sports played in pubs and the local history that has been passed down through the generations." Gipson comments on the social consequences for communities and highlights the plight of many elderly citizens who are becoming increasingly estranged in their local neighbourhoods.

Last year Bow Geezers teamed up with Roman Road Cass students to launch Where's My Boozer Gone?, an initiative to collect images and memories of old pubs.The Bow Geezers brought their black cab to the Roman Road Festival to drum up more support and awareness. Now the _Geezers_ have teamed up with artist Louise Gridley to create a calendar that will highlight the loss of community heritage and social integration. The calendar boys include Ted Lewis, former boxer and Billingsgate fish porter, and Ray Gipson, former liberal councilor, previously featured in Georgia Patsouraki's beautiful [Humans of Roman Road](https://romanroadlondon.com/georgia-patsouraki-humans-of-roman-road-exhibition).

All proceeds from the calendar will be re-invested in their community projects to support the elderly.

A staggering 29 pubs nationwide are closing each week. If you have a pub near you that needs protecting, you can list it with it with you local council as an Asset of Community Value and visit [the Campaign for Real Ale website](https://www.camra.org.uk), an independent, voluntary organisation campaigning for real ale, community pubs and consumer rights.

The calendar is due for release on Monday 9th November with a launch event at The Eleanor on Old Ford Road, one of Bow's much loved traditional boozers run by Frankie who loves nothing better than bringing out traditional pub games and getting everyone dancing together at his famous 'non-disco disco' Minestrone of Sound.

The calendar costs £8 and is available to buy at Amazon.
