Transport for London is proposing a cycle-friendly transformation of East London, affecting Hackney all the way to the Isle of Dogs.

If the plans are approved an uninterrupted 7.5km Cycleway could run through Hackney, [Victoria Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/), Bow, Mile End, and Limehouse, with construction beginning as early as this winter.

The plans are part of the Mayor of London’s transport strategy, which aims to encourage more walking, cycling, and use of public transport in the capitol.

Bow West councillor Val Whitehead said: "I’m keen to see an improved cycle route from Hackney to Isle of Dogs and discourage Grove Road as a commuting route but am also concerned about where local residents and businesses who need to cross Victoria Park will divert to. 

" TfL say they are unable to do traffic modelling until the Liveable Streets team has a working proposal, but I’m not clear that there will be another full consultation by TfL on the Victoria Park section so I would urge everyone who has a view, positive or negative, to respond to TfL."

The consultation phase for the proposals ends on 21 June, with further consultations to take place for Grove Road and the Isle of Dogs at later dates.

Key parts of the proposals include:

- Implementing a 20mph speed limit on Burdett Road
- A dedicated cycling route running from Hackney to Limehouse
- Making the stretch of Grove Road that runs through Victoria Park bus, cycle, and taxi only between 7am and 7pm
- New trees planted throughout the route

The cycling route would be be given its own segregated lane on Burdett Road and West India Dock Road.

Designs for Grove Road and Old Ford Road roundabout will be consulted at a later date as part of the [£3.3million Liveable Neighbourhoods project](https://romanroadlondon.com/tfl-plans-3-million-transformation-bow-roman-road/) being led by Tower Hamlets Council.

Although the proposals are not environmentally focused, TfL hopes the improvements will prompt more Londoners to walk, cycle, and use public transport.

The proposals are part of TfL’s Vision Zero project, which aims to end deaths and serious injuries on London transport by 2041.

TfL predicts that the changes will improve the journey times of the 277 and D6 bus routes, although the 15 and 115 routes are expected to slow slightly. The number 8 route is unaffected by the proposed changes.

Subject to the results of the consultation, construction could begin as early as this winter.
