Chrisp Street Spring Fayre will feature seasonal celebrations for the whole family to enjoy at the historic marketplace. 

The first purpose-built pedestrianised shopping area in the UK, Chrisp Street has seen many fayres, fetes, and market-days in its time. 

To add to the list, on Saturday 26 March the Chrisp Street Spring Fayre will be taking place from 12pm to 4pm, with free activities for all the family. 

From children’s play at Carmen’s café, to spring-themed storytime at the Idea Store, and colouring stations dotted along the street, there’s plenty of entertainment to last the afternoon. 

East End-based social enterprise Sunny Jar Eco Hub will be hosting a craft workshop where you can learn how to upcycle plastic bags and other discarded material into a bouquet of spring flowers. 

And local cycling hub, Chrisp Street Community Cycles, has proved incredibly popular in the neighbourhood, inspiring more women to get into cycling. This well-loved local space will be offering a free service where you can bring your bike down to the hub for a free check-up with an experienced mechanic.

If Mother’s Day on Sunday 27 March has slipped your mind, the fayre has you covered. Children aged 6 to 12 can drop in for a free Art Club session to make cards for their mothers. 

Children can also take part in a trail around Chrisp Street to see all of the shop window displays and vote for their favourite. Everyone who completes the trail will get a prize and will be in with a chance of winning a £100 voucher for a local Chrisp Street business.
