The arrival of Access Creative College, whose patron is Ed Sheeran, reinforces Whitechapel as a key part of East London's creative hub.

Access Creative College (ACC) opened the doors of its new building this September. It has moved to the heart of Whitechapel on Commercial Road from its previous location in Shoreditch. 

Work is ongoing on parts of the building, including on a multifunctional event space, but this will be finished in the next three weeks.

The college offers courses in media, music, games and Esports. Learners can study for B-Tech, T-Level, RSL, and Access to Higher Education qualifications. 

It has around 500 pupils, primarily from 16 to 18 years old. The college also offers adult education courses, an offering which they hope to expand in the near future. 

The college aims to help students learn industry-relevant skills. Ex and current industry professionals teach the courses. And learners have access to a range of industry-level facilities. The college hums with sound from music studios, and it integrates a greenscreen and photo studio into learning.

Access Creative encourages students to build skills by engaging with local businesses in Whitechapel. For instance, one student did some photography for the coffee shop opposite ACC, Coffee LDN, building their portfolio while also having an impact on the local area. 

Alexandra, a student at Access Creative, said that her course in game design had allowed her to build her confidence and develop her own artistic style. As a self-confessed competitive person, she finds studying in an environment with people who share her passions motivating.

‘We are committed to creating a learning environment that is vibrant and exciting, but also reflects professional industry’ said Nathan Loughran, Director of Campus. Loughran believes ACC can help ‘talented individuals from all backgrounds’ access hard-to-break into creative industries. 

The college is part of the wider Access Creative group. They have colleges across the UK including in Manchester, Bristol, and Birmingham.
