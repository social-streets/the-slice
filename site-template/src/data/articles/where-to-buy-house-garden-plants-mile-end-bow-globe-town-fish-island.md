With plant shops springing up in the Roman Road area, it seems the potted house plant is our new best friend.

We’ve noticed the growing number of plant shops around the Roman. From humble little market stalls to a community-led garden centre, the love for plants appears to be blossoming in the East End. Research shows that Britons spend more than £300 a year on [houseplants](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/houseplants) – with Gen Z found to be the biggest fans of our green little friends. 

With the Roman Road area filled with garden-less flats and apartments, it is indoor plants that are being used to improve feng-shui. The most popular plants owned by Britons are spider plants, aloe vera, and peace lilies. Other popular foliage to keep in a home include swiss cheese plants, venus flytraps and weeping fig plants.

Want to bring some life into your home with your own small jungle? Well, look no further, as we have compiled the best local plant stores in Bow, Globe Town and Mile End to help decorate your home.
