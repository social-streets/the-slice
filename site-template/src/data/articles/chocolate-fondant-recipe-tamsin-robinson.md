As we look to comfort foods to get us through this winter lockdown, we asked local Le Cordon Bleu-trained pastry chef **Tamsin Robinson** to share simple recipes using ingredients that can be sourced from the local corner shop.

This week, Robinson shares the secret to her irrestible melting chocolate fondants. 'Chocolate fondants have to be one of the ultimate chocolate desserts,' says Robinson. 'They are simple to make at home, by hand, and can be made a day or two in advance and popped in the oven just before serving. Our recipe makes two, but you can easily double or triple the amounts as required!'

#### Ingredients

Makes two

Cocoa powder, for dusting  
60g unsalted butter (plus extra for greasing)  
65g good quality dark chocolate  
½ tsp espresso powder  
35g golden caster sugar  
1 egg  
60g plain flour  
Pinch of salt  
Cream or ice cream to serve

#### Method

1)   First prepare your ramekins. Take two ramekins and grease generously with butter. Place a heaped teaspoon of cocoa powder in each, and shake it about so that it covers every inch of butter. (This lines the ramekin so the fondants are easy to remove).

2)   Place the ramekins in the fridge to chill, until needed later**.**

3)   On to the chocolate batter. Melt the 60g butter with dark chocolate either in the microwave or on the hob. Once melted, stir in the espresso powder and set aside to cool slightly.

4)   In a separate large bowl, whisk together the sugar and the egg until the mixture becomes slightly thickened and frothy.

5)   Pour in the cooled chocolate and butter mixture. Mix until just combined.

6)   Sift in the flour and salt. Mix again until combined.

7)   Take your ramekins from the fridge, and fill with your chocolate batter.

8)   Chill these in the fridge until firm (no less than 30 mins but they can be left in the fridge, covered with cling film, for up to 2 days).

9)   Preheat your oven to 180C.

10)   Bake the fondants on the middle shelf for 18 mins exactly.

11)   Once baked, removed from the oven and wait 1 minute before demoulding from the ramekins.

12)   Serve with cream, ice-cream, or just as they are!
