Over the next few days and weeks, people will want to find spaces for quiet reflection but where can they go to? 

With the announcement of the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the country has entered a period of mourning. 

Over the next few days and weeks, people will seek solace and comfort. Naturally, many will turn to religious and spiritual spaces as an outlet for their grief, and our area’s many churches, temples, and centres are responding to this need. Some are varying their opening times and holding extended, or extra, services in [tribute to the Queen](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61605149), while others are encouraging people to come and just sit in quiet contemplation. Whatever or however you feel, there will be a place for you to have the space to reflect.

##### St Paul Old Ford 

Led by The Reverend Darius Weithers and Reverend April Keech, St Paul Old Ford is hosting special prayer times on Friday 9 September. The first is at 8.30 am, the second at midday and the last at 6.30 pm.

The church is open at the weekend and is encouraging people to come at any time during the day on Saturday 10 September to light a candle and say a prayer. On Wednesday 14 September at midday, people can go to the prayer chapel and light candles. Closer to the funeral, the church will hold another service, details of which are to be confirmed.

##### London Buddhist Centre 

This Roman Road institution has been welcoming Londoners to its expert-led meditation, yoga and mindfulness classes since it was [founded nearly 50 years ago](https://romanroadlondon.com/london-buddhist-centre-east-london/). The Centre is maintaining its regular schedule of lunchtime meditation sessions, which take every Monday to Saturday from 1pm to 2pm, and its Tuesday and Wednesday evening sessions. Alongside its sessions, it is encouraging people to use its peaceful space to reflect, contemplate and process their grief.

##### Green spaces and surrounding canals

If going to a church or centre and spending time indoors isn't how you want to reflect, Green Park and Hyde Park have Floral Tribute Gardens where you can lay flowers. If that is too far, then head somewhere closer to home such as [Victoria Park](https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/leisure_and_culture/parks_and_open_spaces/victoria_park/victoria_park.aspx) for a peaceful walk, or take a stroll along the canal. While we all know that green space and spending time by water can have a positive impact on our physical and mental health, research has shown that spending time in nature can also teach people to grieve due to parks' and natural spaces' cyclical nature of birth, growth, death and loss.
