A new PureGym opened at Bow Wharf today. It opened its doors at 9am this morning following a three-month refurbishment of the space, which used to be a Soho Gyms site.

Staffed by 11 personal trainers, the gym is stocked with a full range of cardio and weight equipment and has a studio with a capacity of 16. More space has been created by reducing the size of the changing rooms, which are now unisex with two showers. It will be open 24/7 year round. Members enter a passcode to enter between 10pm and 5am.

The new gym will run 44 classes per week, all of which are included in the core membership. Classes include circuit training, boot camps, silent disco spinning, yoga, and pilates.

Gym manager Katie Jackson said: 'We want this to be a place where people feel at home when they train. Larger gyms can't always provide for individual needs, but we're able to do a lot of one-on-one coaching.'

Monthly membership is currently being offered at a pre-sale price of £24.99 per month, with a £10 booking fee. The cost will rise to £29.99 when the pre-sale ends.

Extra Memberships cost £35.99 and allow access to multiple gyms, buddy access four times per month, and the option to freeze membership for up to three months.

Next door to the gym is the [East London Liquor Company](https://romanroadlondon.com/alex-wolpert-east-london-liquor-company/), and the two are already looking into crossover opportunities for members.

Personal trainer Pa Njie said: 'Obviously it's the first day, but we're trying to create a family vibe here. All the trainers get along really well. Customers can feel that when they come in.'

This is the 222nd PureGym opened in the UK.

_The new gym can be found at 221 Grove Road, E3 5SN. Visit Puregym.com to learn more_.
