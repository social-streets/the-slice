After the Council validated a draft Neighbourhood Plan for Roman Road Bow, residents are being urged to speak up and have their say.

Local residents are being urged to voice their views and opinions in the latest draft of the Neighbourhood Plan for Roman Road Bow, after having been recently validated by the Council. 

After [five years of community development and consultation](https://romanroadlondon.com/bow-neighbourhood-draft-plan-announced/), Tower Hamlets Borough Council has validated the draft Neighbourhood Plan for Roman Road Bow. 

The Plan is now undergoing a period of public consultation, which began on 6th December and will end on 31st January 2022. 

Local resident and Committee Member for the Plan Mike Mitchell said: ‘The consultation provides another important opportunity for people who live, work or study in Bow to contribute to it, helping ensure the Plan reflects the majority's wishes.’

After the consultation, the Plan then goes to an independent examiner to consider if it meets certain basic conditions and other legal requirements.

If successful, the Neighbourhood Plan will, for the first time, give local residents the power to shape the planning decisions, economic development and growth in the Roman Road Bow area up to 2031.

The body responsible for overseeing the drafting and development of the Neighbourhood Plan is ​​Roman Road Bow Neighbourhood Forum which was established in 2016, five years after the introduction of the Localism Act 2011. The concept is to empower communities to decide how the land in their area should be used.

Flexible use of high street shops, designating pubs as local heritage assets, and greater protection of green spaces are just some of the key themes and policies put forward by the Plan.

The Bow Neighbourhood area extends from Globe Town to the west, Victoria Park to the north, Mile End to the south and the London Legacy Development Corporation area to the east. It covers key local landmarks including Roman Road Market, parts of Mile End Park, Bow House Business Centre, as well as tens of thousands of local residents.

The Forum is encouraging residents to respond to the consultation and give their views on the development and use of land in the area.

Mitchell said: ‘It is crucial as many people as possible speak up now. This is the last major opportunity to influence the plan's content.’
