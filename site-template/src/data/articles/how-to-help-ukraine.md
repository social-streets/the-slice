As Russia escalates its war against Ukraine, find out how to help the people of Ukraine.

As the war in Ukraine dominates the news, many of our readers have reached out to us about how to support those who now find themselves in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. We look at how best we can support our fellow Ukrainians in their hour of need.

Since Russia renewed its invasion of the country in the early hours of Thursday 24 February, around 600,000 Ukrainians have fled their homes according to the UN refugee agency and there are reports that tens of thousands are on the move within the country itself. In addition, Ukrainian reports estimate that more than 4.5 million more could follow if the fighting spreads. 

Millions are at risk of losing their home, having limited access to medical supplies, and suffering the consequences of the psychological trauma of war.

Alongside many members of the international community such as France, Germany, America, and Australia, the [UK government has imposed sanctions](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-statement-on-further-economic-sanctions-targeted-at-the-central-bank-of-the-russian-federation) on Russia. These include freezing assets of Russian oligarchs and banning all Russian commercial and private jets from UK airspace.

As Ukrainian citizens face escalating conflict, violence, and displacement if you want to support the people of Ukraine, here are some suggestions.

#### Support local initiatives and national charities

Roman Road Market's family-run [Sinclairs Pharmacy](https://www.instagram.com/p/CakHc0vo3cZ/) are accepting donations to help the team provide and send medical equipment, medicines, and toiletries to support those directly affected by the war in Ukraine. Either give donations at the pharmacy directly (557-559 Roman Road, E3 5EL) or call them on 020 8980 5743 if you are unable to gift in person.

Tuck Shop and [The Rambling Beer Company](https://www.ramblingbeerco.com/store/p28/Beer_Tasting_for_Ukraine.html?fbclid=IwAR2TxxqLnf-tPCbbScmI5CTjUt9w62slChaqpD4YmDHLuaO-X-MvLGfKFcA) in Hackney Wick have teamed up for a beer tasting to raise money for the [DEC Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal](https://www.dec.org.uk/) on Saturday 5 March. All of the proceeds will go to DEC. Over an hour and a half, taste five beers all while talking all things beer, at the price of £10 a head (options to pay more if you wish).

Hackney Bridge has set up a [Ukraine Crisis Donation drop-off point](https://www.instagram.com/p/CahmFBrojvT/) at Hackney Bridge Kitchens.

All items are going to the Polish-Ukraine border.

The Romanian community in Canning Town is organising a collection for [12 March at St. Margaret's R.C. Church, Bethell Avenue, E16 4JU](https://www.facebook.com/events/5000062876683560).

The Ukrainian Embassy in London has set up a [special fund](https://www.withukraine.org/en) to support Ukraine and its people.

Anna Dezyk, deputy chair of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain (AUGB), set up [the crowdfunding campaign Help Ukraine Emergency Appeal](https://www.gofundme.com/f/helpukraine?utm_campaign=p_cp%20share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link_all&utm_source=customer&fbclid=IwAR0aTUeoTfg3P6d_yWa0VcRLkc0oz3Y4e8tEwV7-oy83PI1xJAU3ahDa2XQ). Donations given will provide medicines, food, and services to support the most vulnerable to overcome the consequences and trauma of war. Organisations involved in the appeal include AUGB, the Association of Ukrainian Women (AUW), and The Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of the Holy Family of London.

Voices of Children is a Ukrainian organization that provides psychological care for kids dealing with the trauma of war. Its work is focused in Donetsk and Luhansk, two areas that have been particularly hard hit by Russian aggression. They are taking donations via [their website portal](https://voices.org.ua/en/donat/).
