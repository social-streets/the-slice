From the makers that brought Rome to Roman Road with their authentic pizzas, Italian coffees, and desserts, The Bakery Room is now bringing the capital’s iconic afternoon tea from the West End to the East End, but with an Italian twist

It’s been a year since we welcomed the brightly decorated pink patisserie shop, The Bakery Room to Roman Road.

Since then, it has made a distinct name for itself, impressing locals with its selection of indulgent cakes, bakes, and authentic Italian desserts. So it comes as little surprise that the café has tapped into the market of another indulgent treat; that of afternoon tea.

Launching in mid-October, the café’s afternoon tea became available for customers to pre-order in-store and online. 

For £13, customers can expect a mouth-watering fusion of British, French, and Italian afternoon tea products, from the classic cream cheese and cucumber sandwiches to scones, mini tarts adorned with fresh fruit, almond cookies, and beignets filled with lemon custard or pistachio cream.

And as for its drinks? Well, it’s never too early for a cocktail. The Bakey Room’s customers can choose from a menu of cocktails from Aperol Spritz to Gin Tonic, and sweet wines such as Moscato and Passito. There is also the classic Italian sparkling wine, Prosecco, available for an additional £4 as well as traditional English tea and coffee. 

Speaking with Oriana Ragusa, the café’s store manager, she proudly stated that the idea of afternoon tea at The Bakery Room was to make a traditionally exclusive experience more affordable and accessible: ‘This kind of afternoon tea is really for locals: not expensive. This is just an idea that I want to share with customers and propose something that might be attractive to them.’ 

While the café’s launch of afternoon tea is still in its infancy, partnerships with other local businesses are already in the works, starting with the local wine shop, [Vinarius](https://romanroadlondon.com/vinarius-bringing-italian-french-now-english-wines-roman-road/).

Vinarius have been operating on Roman Road for seven years, and are most known for their specialist Italian, French, and English wines. 

The café is currently in the process of transforming the vacant downstairs room into a cosy dining area for sit-in afternoon tea.
