Gear up for the festive season with our guide to the best place to buy a Christmas tree in Tower Hamlets including tree-sellers that offer click-and-collect as well as delivery.

It's that time of year again in Tower Hamlets [when die-hard Christmas fans are already beginning to decorate their houses](https://romanroadlondon.com/christmas-lights-roman-road-2020/) (have you seen the Giant Grinch on Norman Grove in Bow?) and the rest of us are planning which weekend to block out to collect our tree and get our homes ready for Christmas.

Nothing beats the unmistakable pine scent of a traditional, live Christmas tree in your room, and even the smallest flat or most chaotic shared house can fit in a plump little Norway Spruce. 

If you’re lucky to have tall ceilings but narrow rooms, we recommend the slimmer, skyscraper silhouette of a Frasier Fir, America’s most popular tree.

Tower Hamlets has some rather epic options for a festive expedition to pick out the perfect Christmas tree for your space and offers many convenient street corner options too.  

If you’re worried about carrying home a big tree or disposing of it, some places offer delivery and collection services.

[Check out our Interactive Christmas Treemap](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1t1CXWxun9GGXu1S3N_KNDbyut6up4IVR&ll=51.531803631277796%2C-0.049609635345166936&z=14) to see all locations.

Herbert and Sons, a familiar name on Roman Road, is a family-owned fruit and veg stall with 75 years of history. Owner Marc, son of Lesley, will once again be selling Christmas trees at Globe Town Market Square from the first weekend of December, but [only on Saturdays since he reduced his days.](https://romanroadlondon.com/herberts-fruit-and-salad-globe-town/)

This is an opportunity to bag a Scottish Norwood tree ranging from 3 ft-9 ft from a proper East London stall with a real legacy. Marc also offers a free delivery service to any E2 post-code, bringing a sprinkle of Christmas to elderly and vulnerable people in the area.

Head down to Globe Town Market to say hello to Marc, grab a tree and buy some festive oranges.

Hackney Wickmas Trees at Hackney Bridge has a selection of Nordmann Firs ranging from 4 to 12 feet tall. This variety will leave more room under the tree for presents not needles with their non-drop quality, holding onto their needles longer than most other Christmas tree varieties.

They also have softer foliage that’s gentle on little hands and paws so a good choice for families with children and pets.

The covered Hackney Bridge hub offers food vendors, a bar, independent shops and a Thursday night market, so it’s a great option if you want to make an evening of it. Pre-orders are available now to collect from 23rd November.
