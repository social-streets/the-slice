This year's festive trip to Poplar with our favourite midwives from Nonnatus House will be a double-bill special.

The BBC and Neal Street productions announced that this year’s Call the Midwife Christmas Special will be two 60-minute episodes instead of the usual 90-minute episode.

The double bill is expected to give a Christmas cliffhanger and set viewers up for the fourteenth season of the television series which makes its way into the 1970s. 

The trailer hasn't been released yet but the BBC have shared some details of the plot.

[The midwives of Nonnatus House and the other beloved characters](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/call-the-midwife-real-stories/) will be in their usual element, all busy delivering babies but will have to tackle some festive nightmares. 

The funfair arrives in Poplar, bringing excitement to the community, but the threat of the Hong Kong flu casts a shadow over the borough's Christmas festivities.

As if that wasn't enough, news of an escaped prisoner spreads fear among the residents, all while they are trying to prepare for the upcoming carol concert.

Heidi Thomas OBE, creator and writer says: ‘Who doesn’t love finding an extra, unexpected present underneath the Christmas tree?’ 

The regular characters will return for the specials with the Turner children collecting dinky cars and scrap metal for the Blue Peter Christmas appeal. 

Violet is hosting a mince pie competition but preparations for Reggie’s homecoming aren’t exactly smooth sailing. 

Trixie- one of our favourites - will make a fleeting visit to Nonnatus House to visit her brother Geoffrey while Miss Higgins has her grandson stay for Christmas. 

Dame Pippa Harris, executive producer says: 'For the first time viewers can luxuriate in a two-part festive treat this Christmas. Heidi has created a spellbinding special which I know will delight our loyal fans.’ 

The first part of the special will air on Christmas Day, December 25, while the air date for part two has not yet been confirmed.

The filming for the next series of Call the Midwife is nearly finished with eight new episodes launching in early 2025 and has already been commissioned for this fifteenth series.
