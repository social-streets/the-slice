The council will review the way it handles housing register applications after it took six months to review a decision not to place a woman who was fleeing domestic abuse on the housing register.

The Tower Hamlets Council will review the way it handles housing register applications after it was investigated for taking six months to reconsider the decision not to place a woman fleeing domestic abuse on the housing register.

The woman was initially told she did not qualify for the housing register because she had not lived in the borough for long enough, having moved there due to her situation.

When she asked the council to review its decision, it took Tower Hamlets Council half a year to do so, which the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman says should have been decided upon in eight weeks.

An investigation by the Ombudsman found the council had a “huge backlog” in processing applications to join its housing register.

A council spokesperson said they “fully accept” the report and its findings, which they said came at a time when the council was facing an “unprecedented demand for housing services”.

As a result of the investigation, the council has apologised to the woman and has been awarded £500 due to the stress it has caused her.

The woman, who has mobility problems, had asked the council for help after her landlord said they wanted their property back.

Due to her medical conditions, the woman told the council how she was unable to leave the property as she could not use the stairs to its entrance.

However, the council told her she did not qualify to join its housing register as she had not lived in Tower Hamlets for long enough.

She then asked the council to review its decision, and six months later was told the council was not going to change its decision.

The woman complained and the council apologised for not considering her medical conditions properly and agreed to reconsider the woman’s application on medical grounds.

She was then placed on priority band 2B, which is for people in housing need without a local connection to the area but was not told about her right to review this decision.

The Ombudsman investigation found the council failed to assess her application on medical grounds when she first made contact in January 2022 and found the council was at fault for not telling the woman about her right to a review of its decision.

Amerdeep Somal, the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman said it was “unacceptable” that the council took six months to decide on the woman’s homelessness application.

Ms Somal said: “Taking six months to decide a person’s homelessness application – when the process should only take eight weeks is simply unacceptable.

“While the faults I have identified have not stopped the woman from successfully bidding on a property, the time taken for the council to consider her application, and its initial failure to consider her medical needs can only have added to her distress.”

She added: “I hope reviewing the way it considers applications, and the action plan it has agreed to draw up, will significantly reduce waiting times for everyone in the borough.”

Abdirahim Hassan, local campaigner and co-founder of grassroots organisation Coffee Afrik, who challenged the council last year on its housing allocation to vulnerable women predominantly from the Somali community, welcomed the review.

Mr Hassan said: “It is vitally important for Tower Hamlets Council and specifically its housing department to reset, learn from unjust practice and ensure that housing allocations and housing services in general are more equitable, fair and just. 

“At the moment, too many residents are struggling with no emails responded to, no call-backs and generally a huge waiting list that often is because of inefficiency and poor leadership.”

He added: “The housing campaign that we supported last year is still fighting for justice and that is why they are going to the High Court this year.”

A spokesperson for the council said: “We fully accept the report and its findings, and we apologise to \[the woman\] for the upset caused by delays in processing her housing register application and initial banding placement.

“These findings came at a time when we were facing unprecedented demand for housing services. Our team is working hard to improve and already acting on the report’s recommendations.”

At the time the woman went to the council for help, the council had 21,697 households on the housing register – this number has since risen to over 24,000 households.

Following the investigation, the council has made several changes including “simplifying” the process for housing register applications to speed up decisions and reduce the backlog of applications.

A £1.3million one-off investment programme is set to improve the customer journey which includes improvements in ICT, the physical working environment and enhanced staff training.

During a cabinet meeting on May 16, members approved a £1.9m ongoing investment year-on-year to improve the council’s housing options services, which includes the creation of 30 new posts which range from housing officers to caseworkers.
