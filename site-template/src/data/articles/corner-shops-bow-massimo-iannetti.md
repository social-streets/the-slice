Corner shops are one of the staples of city life, their owners the unsung heroes of convenience shopping. Here, local photographer Massimo Iannetti spent an evening walking the streets of Bow, capturing the neighborhood's corner shops and those who run them.

The East End has a long tradition of family-run corner shops serving their communities, and that continues to this day. Some things are so familiar, so homely, that we barely notice they're there. When night falls and the city sleeps, these shops keep their doors open.

At a time when the [high street is struggling and retail is dominated by the likes of Sainsbury's and Tescos](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-93329/Asian-corner-shops-decline.html), Iannetti's photographs are a reminder that countless stores are holding firm against the tide, no two quite the same.
