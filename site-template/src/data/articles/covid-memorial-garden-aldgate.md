Remembering the lives lost to the pandemic through the healing design of a Covid memorial garden

Transport for London (TfL) announced plans for a Covid memorial garden in Braham Street, Aldgate, to honour the 98 transport worker victims who lost their lives to the coronavirus pandemic. 

It is planned for the memorial site to be situated on a pedestrianised plaza, containing a plaque that pays tribute to the people who passed away and benches to allow people to reflect and remember the victims. It will also honour taxi and private hire drivers.

A cherry blossom tree will also be planted at the site, in the same fashion as the public garden that was unveiled in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park last year, in remembrance of all the Londoners who lost their lives to the pandemic.

Mayor of Tower Hamlets, John Biggs said: 'TfL staff have been dedicated in keeping our city moving through the pandemic and we owe them a debt of gratitude for their service to Londoners. Very sadly a number of transport workers have passed away due to coronavirus, it's fitting that we remember them with this memorial and my sincere condolences go out to their families.’

Plans to create Covid memorial gardens were made in August last year in order to honour the victims of coronavirus. 

Creating memorial gardens has been around since World War One, created to remember victims of a variety of events. 

When talking to the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-53592911), Andy Langford, Cruse Bereavement Care clinical director, said: ‘Memorial gardens can anchor people to memories of special times they spent with someone.’

The design of the garden is important in order to create an atmosphere for grief and healing, especially after having to socially distance from loved ones and stay indoors for the lengthy period of lockdowns.

TfL aims to submit a planning application to Tower Hamlets Council for the memorial by early 2022.
