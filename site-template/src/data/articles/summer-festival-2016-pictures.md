The [third Roman Road Summer Festival](https://romanroadlondon.com/event/summer-festival-2015/) brought Roman Road Market to life with live music all day, a Cockney Corner with East End music, language, games and entertainment, children's craft workshops and street entertainment from buskers, stilt dancers and roving performers, plus hot food, guided heritage tours and over 50 stalls including 40 designer-makers from Urban Makers East.

It was a glorious hot summer's day and 12,000 people turned out from near and far to enjoy this homegrown community event, made from 90% local ingredients. Here are some of the highlights caught on camera.
