If you’re looking for a good read in which to immerse yourself, with all the spare hours we have suddenly found ourselves, you need not look further than our own neighbourhood.

The East End’s rich, multilayered history means the many peoples from the cultures and social movements of our area have contributed their own stories, which are captured in the written word through autobiography, non-fiction, biography - every way imaginable.

Are you a fan of the gangster genre? Perhaps you like Dickens? There’s a book that for all tastes, inspired by the extraordinary people and events within our very streets.

## Books about the history of the East End

Fancy getting lost in history? Try [The Story of the Huguenots](https://romanroadlondon.com/the-story-of-the-huguenots-joyce-hampton-book-review/) by Joyce Hampton, about the French settlers in the 1700s who left their mark on our culture and way of life. 

Let’s go forward a century or so, to the East End during the Industrial Revolution.

The Victorian slums captured the imaginations of many writers at the time - most famously, Charles Dickens. But let’s not forget [Israel Zangwill](https://romanroadlondon.com/east-end-writer-israel-zangwill-old-ford-road/), the renowned Jewish historical literary figure who grew up on Old Ford Road and was known as ‘the Dickens of the ghetto’.

Check out the full list of Victorian novels, East-End style:

- If you like Great Expectations try _Children of the Ghetto_: Zangwill’s influential novel about the working-class Jewish community.

- A Sherlock Holmes fan? For a classic Victorian detective mystery with a local twist, check out Zangwill’s _The Big Bow Mystery_, which has had three Hollywood film adaptations. 

- Enjoyed the realism of Dickens’ _Little Dorrit_? Then you will like Jack London’s _People of the Abyss_: a first-hand account of the East End slums.
