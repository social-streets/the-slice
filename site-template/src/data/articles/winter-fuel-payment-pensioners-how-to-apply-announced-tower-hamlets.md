The scheme was announced in October however pensioners were not sure how to apply for the payments until Thursday's announcement from the Council.

The Council’s Winter Fuel Payment scheme began its roll-out last Thursday 5 December with an announcement at the Idea Store warm hub in Whitechapel and letters sent from the Mayor to eligible pensioners across the borough. 

Each letter, which is personalised and secure, can be presented at any Post Office branch to immediately collect cash payments of £175 per person. The letters contain a Post Office Payout barcode. 

Letters have been sent out today to pensioners that the Council knows are eligible. You can apply for the payment directly by visiting [forms.towerhamlets.gov.uk/service/Apply\_for\_the\_Tower\_Hamlets\_Winter\_Fuel\_Payment](https://forms.towerhamlets.gov.uk/service/Apply_for_the_Tower_Hamlets_Winter_Fuel_Payment) or by calling 0207 364 5040. 

Recipients can also send someone to collect the payment for them by presenting the recipient's ID.

The one-off lump-sum payment is intended to help pensioners cover their bills after the Winter Fuel Payment was cut back by the central government. 

It is part of a larger borough-wide winter support plan, which includes warm hubs and a scheme to help households claim pension benefits. There are also plans to introduce a Meals on Wheels program and elderly luncheon clubs. 

Pension Credit can be claimed by calling the helpline on 0800 99 1234 or online at [Gov.u](http://www.gov.uk/pension-credit)[k/pension-credit](http://www.gov.uk/pension-credit). 

Two-thirds of the nearly £1 million budget for the Winter Fuel Payment is from the Council’s coffers, and the rest has been allocated from the Household Support Fund the Council receives from the central government.  

The scheme was initially announced in October, but [pensioners were not sure how to apply or who was eligible up until now, causing confusion in the borough.](https://whitechapellondon.co.uk/tower-hamlets-winter-fuel-payment-local-voices/) 

Mayor Lutfur Rahman said: ‘As winter bites and temperatures plummet, we have stepped in to fill the void left by the removal of the Winter Fuel Allowance. We're restoring this vital lifeline for pensioners in Tower Hamlets, who are receiving letters from me, allowing them to instantly collect cash payments at any Post Office branch.’ 

Maggie Phillips, 86 from the Isle of Dogs who attended the Idea Store warm hub said: ‘The Winter Fuel Payment scheme is good news for many older people living here. We are fortunate to have a thriving community sector which looks out for older people and I am pleased the council is listening to us.’
