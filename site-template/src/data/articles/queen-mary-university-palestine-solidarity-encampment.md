As pro-Palestinian encampments spread across UK universities, Tower Hamlets’ has the Mayor’s support.

Students from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) set up an encampment in solidarity with Palestine on Monday. The students are part of a growing trend of pro-Palestine encampments in UK universities, calling on their institutions to respond differently to the Israel-Gaza war. 

The group has set up tents on the lawn of the Queens’ Building indefinitely, drawing attention to student concerns about the university’s response to the Israel-Gaza war. They are demanding changes in QMUL’s policies, including divestments of funds connected to Israel and a boycott of Israeli universities. 

The encampment is part of growing dissent at the university. Recently [more than 250 academics at QMUL signed an open letter calling on the university to condemn the arrest of Professor Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian.](https://romanroadlondon.com/queen-mary-university-academics-open-letter-condemn-israel-arrest-palestinian-scholar-nadera-shalhoub-kevorkian/) 

She is a Palestinian professor who was arrested in Israel last month, following comments she made on a podcast about Hamas on October 7.

QMUL is one of many pro-Palestine encampments quickly appearing in UK universities, including those at UCL, the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, Bristol University, and the University of Edinburgh. 

Each encampment has its own set of demands, with many pledging to stay until they are met. Last Thursday, Prime Minister [Rishi Sunak called a meeting with university bosses,](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-pm-sunak-tells-university-bosses-protect-jewish-students-2024-05-09/) citing concern that the encampments would cause harassment and antisemitic abuse. 

In Tower Hamlets, the Palestinian debate has impacted local politicians. The borough has a Muslim population of almost 40%, the largest in England and Wales. Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, Rushanara Ali, was [heavily criticised for not backing an immediate ceasefire](https://romanroadlondon.com/school-strike-protest-palestine-cease-fire-rushanara-ali-tower-hamlets/) in November 2023. Coming up to the General Election, some are speculating the move could cost her seat. 

Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman has continuously backed an immediate ceasefire. In April, Rahman removed Palestinian flags from council buildings, [saying they were being used in media to further an Islamophobic narrative](https://romanroadlondon.com/palestinian-flags-removed-tower-hamlets-mayor/). On X, the Mayor declared that the members of the encampment at QMUL had his support, calling the movement a ‘historic international call for justice’. His tone is a sharp contrast to Sunak and the Government. 

The encampment has demanded that QMUL stop all investments in companies with Israeli ties, such as Booking.com, Barclays and Siemens. The students have also requested that the university condemn Israel’s military activity in Gaza, and call it genocide. 

Currently, the university uses the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, and an additional request is to switch to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition, which allows more liberal criticism of Israel. In addition, the encampment is demanding the university boycott Israeli universities, and create scholarships for Palestinian students. 

In their letter, the encampment stresses that QMUL's refusal to engage with its demands ‘contradicts its own policies and values, revealing its complicity in the oppression and killing of Palestinians in the occupied territories’. 

QMUL was approached for comment but has not yet responded.
