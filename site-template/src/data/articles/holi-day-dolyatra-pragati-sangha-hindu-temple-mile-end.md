How Tower Hamlet's only Bengali Hindu Temple brings the colours and joy of Holi Day to a quiet residential street in Bow.

You may have noticed a small temple on Rhondda Grove with a pretty white dome. It’s Pragati Sangha, Tower Hamlet’s only Bengali Hindu Temple.

On Sunday, the local Bengali Hindu community gathered at Pragati Sangha for Dolyatra, West Bengal’s celebration of Holi Day, the Hindu festival of colours. The word Dolyatra comes from the words "dol" meaning swing and "yatra" meaning procession.

Both Holi Day and Doyatra are observed on the last full moon day of the Hindu calendar, which fell on Monday 25 March this year. Though they celebrate the same day, the festivals each have their unique rituals and originate in different parts of India.

Dolyatra is observed mostly in Eastern India, particularly in Odisha, West Bengal, and the northeastern state of Assam. While Holi commemorates the triumph of the deity Vishnu in the Narasimha avatar over the sinful Hiranyakashipu, Dolyatra is all about the divine love of Lord Krishna.

Krishna - the god of protection, love compassion and tenderness - is a widely revered deity in Hinduism. According to legend, Dolyatra marks the day that Krishna declared his eternal love for the Hindu goddess, Radha.

In the Bengali calendar, the festival celebrates the deity's everlasting bond. In this sense, it’s not just a religious day, but a joyous recognition of life, love and togetherness. Like Holi, Dolyatra is best known for people playing with coloured powders - a reference to Lord Krishna's childhood antics and his love for butter.

On Sunday, families and friends of all ages assembled for the festivities at Pragati Sangha temple, situated a stone’s throw away from Mile End tube station on Rhondda Grove. The temple, which is entirely volunteer-led, aims to preserve Hinduism's rich cultural and religious traditions in the East End.

As the colourful day approached, the temple was adorned with vibrant decorations and floral arrangements, creating a mesmerising sight that beckoned Hindus from across the borough.

The day itself was centred around the grand procession of Lord Krishna and Radha, who were seated on an elaborately decorated palanquin inside the temple.

Traditional music, dances, and cultural performances defined the day, showcasing the unique cultural heritage of Hindusim. [Folk](https://romanroadlondon.com/east-end-folklore/) dances depicting scenes from Lord Krishna's life and melodious bhajans (songs) uplifted spirits and filled the temple with sound.

As the day drew to a close, visitors gathered to partake in a feast of traditional delicacies prepared by volunteers. From savoury snacks to sweet treats, the spread reflected the culinary diversity of India, uniting people in a shared appreciation for good food and community.

We visited the Pragati Sangha temple and immersed ourselves in the ancient festival and exuberant celebrations.
