Aware of the economic climate, businesses along Roman Road are offering deals to customers - if you ever thought about trying them out, now might be the time. 

Independent businesses along Roman Road are finding new and creative ways to encourage custom during the current cost of living crisis.

E3 Vegan, Ona Bento Sushi Bar, and Coffee & Fripes are just some of the businesses which are offering new deals and discounts which they are encouraging local people to take advantage of.

Jordan Kaplan, co-founder of E3 Vegan, said they have introduced ‘a buy one, get the second meal half price’ deal, and are looking into reducing the price of their supper club. It’s the [UK’s first ever vegan supper club](https://www.e3vegan.com/supper-club) and you’re welcomed with a cocktail and nibbles, and that’s before the three-course meal. And, for those with a sweet tooth (who isn’t tempted by something sweet?!), there’s even a pre-dessert before the main thing. What a treat.

Ona’s Bento Sushi Bar is playing with a similar idea. Last week, it introduced a lunch meal deal which can be anything between 20% and 25% off the original price. Ona sources its fish from T&S Enterprises, the same company that supplies upmarket West End fish restaurants, including a three Michelin-starred establishment, The Araki in Soho. Who would've thought you can try West End fish on your doorstep but with East End prices?

And for coffee lovers, Coffee & Fripes is introducing a loyalty card for its hot drinks. Aside from its smooth specialty coffee, its chai latte is also gorgeous - a perfect hand-warming companion as we head into the chillier months.

While plant-based fine dining, raw tuna or salmon sashimi, and flat whites might not be your typical East End fare, now might be the chance to take advantage of these offers while they’re here. You might just surprise yourself...
