How one likes their scone, jam and cream combination often sparks fierce debate amongst East Enders. We asked local Le Cordon Bleu-trained pastry chef **Tamsin Robinson** for her go-to recipe.

For these scones, she bought her ingredients from the newly opened Whole Fresh, the Best Food Centre and [Simply Fresh](https://romanroadlondon.com/simply-fresh-globe-town-mehmet-guzel-interview/) – which are all on Roman Road.

Living in Bow, Robinson tends to get her cake fix from [Loafing](https://romanroadlondon.com/loafing-coffee-crepe-shop-reopens/), and is eager to try more of Java Beans Cafe's sugary bakes.

Serve these delectable scones straight from the oven, lathered in jam and topped with a dollop of fresh clotted cream – or vice versa – alongside a strong brew.

#### Ingredients

Makes 6-8 scones

250g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting  
2 tsp baking powder   
60g cold unsalted butter, diced into small pieces  
40g caster sugar  
60ml whole milk  
2 medium eggs  
1 vanilla pod (or 1 tsp vanilla extract)

#### Method

Preheat your oven to 170°C.

Place the cold butter, flour and baking powder together in a large bowl. Rub the mixture together between your fingertips until it looks like breadcrumbs. (You can also do this using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, or by pulsing in food processor). Set aside. 

Mix one egg, sugar and milk together in a small bowl. Scrape in the seeds of the vanilla pod, or add the vanilla extract, and stir in. 

Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture, and pour in the eggy liquid.

Gently stir together until the mixture begins to form a dough.

Finish forming the dough using your hands, being careful not to overwork the dough. Stop mixing when there are no more dry bits. 

Turn the dough on to a lightly floured work surface and roll to one inch thick.

Use a medium pastry cutter (about 5-6cm in diameter will do nicely) and cut out your scones. Aim to cut out as many as possible before re-rolling the dough to cut more. 

Tip: try to cut your scones out as straight as possible, as a wonky cut may lead to a wonky scone.

Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl, and brush the top of each scone with a little egg. This will give the scones a nice colour.  

Bake in the oven for 15 minutes until golden.

Serve your scones warm with lashings of jam and clotted cream. 'Round here, it's got to be a thick spread of jam, then dollop of cream on top.
