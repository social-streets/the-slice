Rich Mix unveiled an art mural by well-known East End based artist Camille Walala. Spanning across the entire 600 square metres of the building’s back wall, it is the largest contribution to the first ever London Mural Festival.

The Mural Festival festival will run throughout September and beyond with over 150 artists from around the world painting 50-plus large-scale walls across the capital. It is a celebration of street art using the city as a canvas, giving artists a way to showcase their work in a public gallery during the pandemic. 

The mural, named ‘Belleville’, is typical of Walala’s striking style with its vibrant colour and exuberant geometries.

Her recent work includes the makeover of a street in Leyton. The High Road’s new unofficial name is ‘Walala Parade’, as she transforms the buildings using recycled paint in her typical, ‘tribal-pop’ style. 

Judith Kilvington, CEO of Rich Mix says, ‘At Rich Mix, we believe in the transformative power of culture and creativity and it’s great to have something to share that works from social distance, and reflects the dynamism and energy of the activity usually inside our spaces.’

If you plan to venture further afield the Roman Road area to explore more street art, Luke Smile’s ‘Happy Go Lucky’ piece can be spotted next to Brick Lane’s Beigel Bake, and the inspiring words ‘Stronger Together’, by Ben Eine and Rachel Joy, can be found in Leyton.

Rich Mix, which opened last Friday after being closed over coronavirus lockdown, is not yet holding indoor events due to the pandemic, but their cinema is open, along with a select few multi-sensory installations.
