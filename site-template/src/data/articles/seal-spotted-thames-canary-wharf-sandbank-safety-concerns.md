Harbour seals are becoming more frequent visitors to the Thames but experts warn that members of the public must follow safety guidelines to protect both the seals and themselves.

Last week a photo of a seal named Norbert spotted on the banks of the Thames opposite Canary Wharf last Saturday was shared widely on social media leading to concerns over the seal’s welfare.  

Norbert is one of many harbour seals that now call the Thames Estuary home but concerns have grown as the seal has been chased and shooed by some members of the public. 

The seal was photographed by Nick Nomi, who remained at a distance whilst documenting Norbert’s trip onto the sandbank. However, the photograph attracted seal fans to the sandbank and Nomi is now calling for more respect for the seal.

‘\[I\]witnessed an extremely careless man chase the seal across the beach and then attempt to ‘shoo’ the seal back into the water while recording the entire act like he was some seal hating Farage.’ says Nomi.

The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) revealed in September that an estimated 599 harbour seals and 2,988 grey seals were counted in the water and along the sandbanks of the Thames. 

With numbers increasing, seal spotting might become more common across the Thames and there are specific guidelines on what not to do if you spot one. 

If you spot a seal, ZSL advises people to stay at least 50m away from a seal. If you are with a dog put it immediately on a lead and walk away. Never touch a seal because you or it could potentially get hurt. 

ZSL also encourage people to report any seal sightings on their webpage, to help inform their understanding of the biodiversity in the Thames: zsl.org 

The Thames was declared ‘biologically dead’ in 1957 but a report by ZSL in 2021 revealed improvements in biodiversity.

The report revealed evidence of an increase in a range of bird species and marine mammals alongside some surprising species living in the Thames including seahorses, seals, sharks and eels – which could be great news for [jellied eels fans](https://romanroadlondon.com/jellied-eels-cockney-food-east-end/). 

However,  the report also found deteriorating trends in water temperature, sea level rise rates and the state of fish which all contribute to the Thames's environmental health. 

The name of the beach where Norbert was spotted has been withheld for safety reasons. 

The sighting of Norbert, like the increasing presence of seals along the Thames, is a heartening reminder of the river’s recovery, but also that an urban ecosystem where humans and wildlife can live and thrive alongside one another is a delicate one.
