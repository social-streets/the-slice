The Slice magazine gives Tower Hamlets a long-overdue media presence with lifestyle and cultural content that celebrates its diverse community.

The inaugural issue of the first independent magazine dedicated to Tower Hamlets is now available at a stockist near you. 

The printed magazine, _The Slice,_ is published by Social Streets C.I.C., the not-for-profit digital media company that publishes Roman Road LDN. 

Fans of digital magazine Roman Road LDN will recognise the wedge-shaped logo from its weekly newsletter, ‘The Slice from Roman Road LDN’. 

‘The Slice print magazine is the same brand of news and culture that we’ve been producing successfully for a number of years for Roman Road LDN’s weekly newsletter but, in its print format, it will unite all our digital titles in Tower Hamlets, showing the best content from [Bethnal Green LDN](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/), [Whitechapel LDN](https://whitechapellondon.co.uk/), and [Poplar LDN](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/).’ says Social Streets founder Tabitha Stapely. 

As a social enterprise Social Streets uses journalism to strengthen the community by exploring ideas around home and identity and helping people connect with each other.

The first issue includes a photo essay that peeks into the homes of boat owners in Bow, and the real Poplar stories behind the BBC’s Call the Midwives, the boxing heritage of  Bethnal Green and how the murder of Altab Ali in 1978 united the local community in Whitechapel.

The magazine also includes a borough-wide What’s On section, a guide to the best high street finds, and reviews of East End books. 

‘The magazine celebrates Tower Hamlets as a borough’ says Stapely. ‘I want the magazine to reflect its community in all its diversity.’ 

As an independent media title, _The Slice_ has been fully funded by a range of small, local and relevant advertisers. If you like the look of it, that will be because it’s designed by two leading magazine designers, Katie Wilde and Jessica Lockett, designer and art director respectively at [Cosmopolitan](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/) magazine. 

With 10,000 copies available, _The Slice_ is distributed throughout venues, cafes, and community hubs across Tower Hamlets including Abbotts, SNAP, Bow Church, Hackney Wick Underground and WJMeade. A full list of distributors can be found at [Slicemagazine.co.uk](https://slicemagazine.co.uk/distributors/).

Look out for The Slice at  Roman Road Market and Urban Makers Market on Saturday 11th December and at Upmarket on Brick Lane on Sunday 12th December.
