There is nothing that says Christmas more than the amuse-bouche assortment of tinsel tinted events that build up to the main day in question. 

We’ve collated a round-up of some of Bethnal Green’s jolliest of occasions, so you can steer clear of the anxiety of Oxford Street crowds and instead celebrate local craftsmanship, culture and community. An advent calendar of occasions more enduring than the chocolate kind, if you will...

We’ve included a few events with an entirely non Christmassy feel, for those who don’t celebrate Christmas or are already over the long preamble of baubles and supermarket jingles. 

Whether it's sitting back to enjoy a performance, having a good old knees up or getting on top of the stocking fillers, there is something for everyone:

- 1st, 8th, 15th & 22nd December - _Columbia Market Christmas Wednesdays_ 
- 11th December - _A Christmas Carol Story_ at St Margaret's House 
- 11th December - _A Maker’s Fair_ at the Oxford House 
- 11th December - An auction run by local legend Maureen Flanagan at the Blind Beggar pub in aid of the NHS
- Throughout Decembe_r - Lady Lane Kitchen x The Canvas_
- 15th December - _The Great Big Cabaret F\*ckabout_ at  Bethnal Green Working Mens Club
- 18th December - _Raise the Banner_ by The Grand Union Orchestra at St Johns on Bethnal Green
- 18th & 19th December - Performance, music and spoken word by _Cardboard Citizens_ at Rich Mix 

## A Christmas Carol Story 

11 DECEMBER at 2.30PM & 5PM

Ebenezer and his ghoulish gang are back! Hunker down into the Christmas spirit with The Dickens Theatre Company and of course... the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future. This unique adaptation of Dicken’s classic novella presents two actors taking on every role in a fast-paced & action-packed 60-minute production.

## A Maker’s Fair 

11 DECEMBER 11AM - 15.30

Ensure your pennies spent this Christmas are invested back into the community, whilst also the world greener and more sustainable. 

## An Auction in Aid of the NHS 

11 DECEMBER 1PM TILL LATE

Local celeb Maureen Flanagan is hosting a fundraising event to raise money for the NHS. There will be music, a raffle and an auction, including the chance to get your mitts on personal memorabilia from the notorious Kray twins and Charlie Bronson. 

Come and feel like a true East Ender at the Blind Beggars pub on the 11th December, and be regaled by the raconteur Flanagan (who was famously proposed to by Reggie Kray three times). It will sure to be a hoot, whilst also sending a big thank you message to the NHS.

## The Great Big Cabaret F\*ckabout 

15 DECEMBER

And finally, here’s one for anyone fancying a proper knees up to get the spirits high (and on a school night, too!). 

A good ol' classic variety night at the iconic Bethnal Green Working Mens Club...but with a twist!

Stars of the international cabaret scene as you've never seen them before, performing lesser-known routines, trialling ridiculous concepts they've never dared perform before or even attempting to swap genres for the night.

Feel their fear, applaud their audacity, sheathe your schadenfreude!!

50% of proceeds go to Cabaret vs. Cancer
