Our Roman Road LDN tote bags come in lots of bright colours, help support local shops, and are an eco-friendly alternative to plastic shopping bags.

The Roman Road tote bag measures 36cm (14in) wide and 41cm high (16in) and is made of 100% cotton. They are available in five colours: two limited edition festive colours, Berry Red and Holly Green, as well as Cyan Blue, Shocking Pink and Sunflower Yellow.
