Wine shop and restaurant [Symposium](https://romanroadlondon.com/symposium-italian-restaurant-giuseppe-pollifrone-interview/) constantly brings new and exciting food to the Roman. This Tonnarelli (pasta) with succulent red mullet is no different. We promise it's not as complicated as it sounds.

#### Ingredients (for 4 people)

1 White Onion  
5 Limes  
150g Butter Unsalted  
4 Red Mullet Fillets  
50g Pistachios  
100 ml White Wine  
100 ml Water  
500g of Fresh Egg Tonnarelli  
Extra Virgin Olive Oil  
Salt and black pepper to taste

#### For the Lime Butter

Slice the onion very finely and add to a saucepan. Squeeze all the Limes and keep the juice in a bowl. Grate all the lime skins onto a little plate. Add the 100ml of wine, 100ml water, the lime juice and grated skin in with the onion and cook until the onion becomes transparent. Strain the onion juice through a sieve and put the strained juice into a blender. Add 150g of unsalted butter to the juice and blend to make an emulsion.

#### For the Pistachio Pesto

Take a few pistachio nuts and finely chop for some garnish. Boil the remaining Pistachios for 5 minutes. Strain and throw away the water. Peel off the skins once cooled and put the nuts in the blender with a bit of oil. Blend until you get a creamy consistency.

#### For the Red Mullet Sauce

Cut the Red Mullets Fillets in cubes of half a cm. In a wide pan add the Lime Butter and the Pesto. When the butter starts simmering add the mullet cubes and cook for 5/6 minutes.  
Keep all the sauce aside.

#### For the Pasta

Boil 2 Litres of salted water in a large saucepan. When the water starts boiling, add the pasta. Cook the pasta until it is ‘al dente’, or a little under cooked. Keep a bowl of cooking water aside and strain the rest away.  
​  
Add the pasta to the sauce and mix. The sauce has to be creamy and if needed, add a bit of the cooking water.

Garnish with some finely chopped pistachios.
