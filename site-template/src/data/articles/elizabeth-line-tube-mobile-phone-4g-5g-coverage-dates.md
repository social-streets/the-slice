Customers boarding at Whitechapel station will delight to hear that the Elizabeth Line will have 4g and 5g early next year.

By spring 2024, the whole Elizabeth Line, including tunnels, will have 4G and 5G connection. This follows an initial rollout of 4G and 5G coverage on parts of the Central, Northern, and Jubilee Lines. 

Signal will be available in tunnels and stations. So we will soon be able to keep scrolling, make phone calls, or check directions throughout our journeys. Currently, the Internet is only accessible through wifi on platforms.

4G and 5G connection is now available on the Central Line between Oxford Circus and Tottenham Court Road. TFL connected the Northern Line, between Tottenham Court Road and Camden, and the Jubilee Line, between Westminster and Canning Town, earlier this year.

After the Central Line went online, Mayor Sadiq Khan said that he was ‘delighted to see the promise \[he\] made of delivering 4G and 5G across the London Underground continuing to progress’.

Connecting the whole tube network is a monumental task. Five hundred workers are busy every night with the task of laying over 2,000 kilometres of cable and 100s of radio transmitters. 

Next year’s expansion will benefit the 3.5 million people who on average use the [Elizabeth Line](https://whitechapellondon.co.uk/elizabeth-line-history/) each week. This number makes the new line one of the UK’s busiest.
