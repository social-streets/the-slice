A new Sainsbury's Local on Bow Road opens its doors on 17 October 2024 adding to the choice of convenience stores in the area, which includes the Coop under the Green Bridge about 100 metres away, the Tesco Express about 200 metres away opposite Central Foundation School, and the Asda at the Texaco petrol station half a mile away opposite Bow Church DLR.

The new store, opposite [Mile End Tube Station](https://romanroadlondon.com/mile-end-tube-station-history/) on Bow Road and facing the [Pragati Sangha Hindu](https://romanroadlondon.com/pragati-sangha-hindu-temple-mile-end-history/) temple on Rhonnda Grove, looks narrow from the entrance but the inside widens beyond the tills. The store is, in fact, larger than most Sainsbury's Locals.

The part two-storey and part three-storey building with a total floor area of 16,008 sq ft, on a site of 0.26 acres, was owned by the Jane Cart Trust, a charitable foundation for the clergy, who put it up for sale for Â£3 million in 2021.

It was previously occupied by Gateway Housing whose lease ended in November 2023.

Local residents raised concerns over the lack of consultation, increased parking and congestion from delivery lorries, and the sale of alcohol. However, permission was granted with agreements in place to install CCTV and restrict delivery hours.

Sainsbury's Local will open on Thursday 17 October. The opening hours will be Monday to Sunday from 7 am to 11 pm.

Find the new supermarket at 409-413 Mile End Road, London E3 4PB.
