What’s on this autumn 2024 in Tower Hamlets? Indulge in steamy saunas, supper clubs and the strip club revival

_‘Listen! The wind is rising, and the air is wild with leaves, We have had our summer evenings, now for October eves!’_ — Humbert Wolfe

It’s autumn – nature’s noise is slowing and the city is busy again. In Tower Hamlets, All Points East has just packed up, Young V&A won Museum of the Year and the kids are back in school. What’s next? Luckily, we have a slew of events and activities to recommend.  

## Things to watch 

For a start, Rich Mix hosts the Sci-Fi London Film Festival in September. This popular festival was founded by Tower Hamlets local Louis Savy and has been running since 2002. This year you can expect to see mind-bending shorts on everything from time travel to AI. If you miss the in-person event, you can buy a pass online to watch the future from home.  

In September there’s also the Fringe! Queer Film & Arts Festival hosted across the borough with a range of free and paid movies, workshops and art from queer creators. Don’t miss ‘The Life of Sean DeLear,’ a hotly anticipated documentary on the late post-punk legend who influenced designers like Rick Owens, Telfar Clemens and Shayne Oliver. 

For dance, the September performance titled CHIAROSCURO at the Chisenhale Dance Space will feature a live soundtrack and tickets are free. It’s set on the Taiwanese Island of Formosa and explores the dancer’s experience of culture clash. 

And for a taste of fashion, there’s Bethnal Green-based atelier Olubiyi Thomas’ runway show coming up instead. He’s got a unique vibe we’d describe as eco-gothic.  

On the literary side, The Common Press is hosting monthly themed poetry nights. This month’s theme is bisexual poets, and is led by Tamil poet and performer Gayathiri Kamalakantha, who is set to debut a novel-in-verse soon with Faber. 

  
Finally for theatre in late October catch The War of The Worlds at Wilton’s, just back from sell-out run in London and Edinburgh and a tour of the UK. They’ll be putting a twist on the classic sci-fi thriller to explore the era of Fake News – an issue close to our hearts.

## Staycations and explorations 

Craving to unplug already?  [In early September try out an Urban Retreat at the London Buddhist Center.](https://romanroadlondon.com/events/urban-retreat-at-london-buddhist-centre/) From brief meditation sessions to a day of total immersion, you can choose how much of the program you show up for (and all of the events are free). 

To explore with the family, [Sadler’s Wells is hodling a free dance workshop at Poplar Union](https://romanroadlondon.com/events/sadlers-wells-family-freestyle-dance-workshop-poplar-union/) at the end of September, ahead of the opening of their new East Bank location later this year. 

_Not_ for the family – the sex worker-led cabaret show, Sexquisite is hosting two raunchy, explosive and heartfelt shows in Tower Hamlets this Autumn, in September and October. With the East End’s long and complicated tradition of strip and cabaret, it’s exciting to see the scene being reclaimed by performers. _Sexquisite_ will be at a new venue following the closure of [the Bethnal Green Working Men’s Club closed in the summer](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/rally-save-bgwmc-working-mens-club-queer-friendly-venue/). 

If you’re looking for a more regular haunt, drag queen Christina Draguilera hosts a phenomenal quiz night every Monday at the Bow Bells for just £3 – she’s full of banter, booze and beauty. For a sober night, queer writers are welcomed at Common Press’ monthly writing circle for a cosy evening vibe – it’s also £3. 

For art fans, we recommend [this tour following the footsteps of the East London Grou](https://romanroadlondon.com/events/walking-tour-exploring-the-streets-of-the-east-london-group-with-alan-waltham/)p, a mostly working-class artists group who painted east London in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Their work is being revitalised and re-examined by [Bow Arts in an upcoming exhibition](https://romanroadlondon.com/art-exhibitions-east-london/), and this well-researched walk is part of the program.

There's also the Shoreditch Design Triangle from the 14-22 September, a yearly celebration of the East End's creative industry featuring everything from furniture and textiles to flowers and chocolate.

If you’ve missed it in previous years, the Open House festival returns in late September, opening the doors to notable homes and buildings across London. In Tower Hamlets, you can peek into everything from an artist’s studio to the Town Hall. We’re especially curious to see inside of The Mission Building, the iconic former sailor’s haunt which has just had its 100th birthday.

## Eat! 

We’re dying to try Soul Mama in Stratford, a combined restaurant and grassroots music venue founded by celebrity saxophonist YolanDa Brown and music manager Adetokunbo ‘T’ Oyelola. Their menu is a blend of African, Caribbean and South American cuisine, with hand-picked musical talent to watch while you eat. The crowdfunding campaign to open Soul Mama was so successful it broke the Guinness World Record. 

For a one-off special treat, we recommend the imaginative weekly supper clubs at E3 Vegan. The menu is hyper-seasonal, meaning you can expect to start seeing squash, pumpkin, pomegranate and pears.

Lastly, if you prefer to source your ingredients closer to home, try a seasonal foraging walk with Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park. Alternatively, Fish Island’s popular new eatery INIS opened in spring and features a thoughtful seasonal blend of British and Irish cuisine for breakfast and lunch. With beautiful food photography, they’re approaching 5000 followers on Instagram and we’re looking forward to seeing their first autumn menu. 

## Spooky season 

As the days get shorter the shadows begin to show and it’s the perfect time to visit Last Tuesday Society in Bethnal Green. Learn about the history of sigils, haunt cowgirl saloons with matching cocktails or join a guided tour of Victor Wynd’s Museum of Curiosities (this one is not for the faint-hearted). Most of the events include a glass of absinthe (of course). 

Next, for a toe-curling and local, post-punk gig check out bloody/bath at The George Tavern. [The legendary music venue](https://whitechapellondon.co.uk/george-tavern-history/)’s landlady Pauline Foster has continuously fought off threats of closure from developers (which is truly punk). And of course, don’t miss the Halloween Tour at Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park. It’s a ‘lantern-lit tour amongst the tombs of the East End’s famous and infamous dead,’ and tickets sell out quickly. 

Lastly, if you were inspired by the award-winning documentary Smoke Sauna Sisterhood, there’s no need to travel to Romania. Myth Mondays at the Community Sauna Baths in Hackney Wick taps into the magic of the sauna, combining folklore and rituals with relaxing steam.
