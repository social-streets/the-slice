Complete with an Off-Piste bar, live music nights, and an all-new spectator platform, ice skating at Canary Wharf caters to skaters and spectators alike. 

Thought you’d missed the boat on ice skating this winter season? Think again. There’s still plenty of time to get your skates on and don your leotard for a skating session under the twinkling lights of Canary Wharf. 

### Bigger and better

London’s longest-running seasonal ice rink is open for a total of 18 weeks. Canary Wharf offers an even bigger rink than last year stretching across nearly 1,300 square metres in Canada Square Park.

And that’s not all that’s changed this winter: an on-ice events platform takes centre stage on the rink, hosting live music and DJ nights every Wednesday throughout the season. If you fancy skating to your favourite dance classics alongside a live saxophonist, be sure to book a slot on Wednesday 22 February, when Sister Sax will be performing over three skate sessions from 6.40 - 10.45 pm. 

### Something for spectators

Luckily you won’t miss out on the music if you haven’t quite found that Torvill and Dean touch. The rink at Canary Wharf has been fitted out with a new viewing platform so spectators can soak up the magic and watch their friends and family. And you needn’t worry about any unexpected weather events. The rink’s transparent roof has returned this season to ensure that visitors can get their skates on come rain or shine. 

### Rink-side romance

And if that wasn’t enough excitement for one outing, skaters and spectators can warm up with a drink and nibble at the Off Piste alpine bar. Nestled next to the rink for the best views of the action on the ice, what better place to get cosy with a date or enjoy a seasonal cocktail with friends? 

So whether you’re braving the ice with the kids for the first time, or hoping to woo that special someone this Valentine’s Day, ice skating at Canary Wharf caters for all. Don your hat, scarf and gloves for an alternative London activity that doesn’t involve the pub, and head to the rink at Canary Wharf. There’s no better way to embrace winter in the City.
