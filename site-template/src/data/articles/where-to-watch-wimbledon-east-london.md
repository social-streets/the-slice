Game, Set and Watch! From a floating pontoon to screens surrounded by skyscrapers, we’ve compiled a list of where to watch Wimbledon in East London, where both tennis fans and fair-weather friends can enjoy this summer’s grass-court tournament.

## Canary Wharf

BEST FOR: A SMART TURNOUT

The Summer Screens series returns to Canada Square Park and Cabot Square in Canary Wharf once again. Whilst the blocks of London’s business district aren’t quite as green as Henman Hill, the glittering glass of Canary Wharf when met with a hazy sunset still makes for a warm and exciting atmosphere. With a good glass of Pimms in hand, Canada Square Park and Cabot Square are perfect for winding down and watching Wimbledon whilst still in the city. Notably, the tournament is being broadcast for free, and both spots are encircled by food and drink spots. There are even table tennis tables available for those especially inspired by a charged volley.

## St Katharine's Docks

BEST FOR: AN ADVENTURE

Here, enjoy Wimbledon on a pontoon. This floating boat is complete with comfy deckchairs – available on a first-come, first-served basis – and benches and tables for those looking to bring a picnic along. The matches are broadcast for free. Throughout the run of the tournament, there will be food and drink brands on-site showcasing new products for you to try.

## Hackney Bridge

BEST FOR: LAIDBACK VIBES

Catch court action canalside on Hackney Bridge, located on the edge of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. For Wimbledon 2023, Hackney Bridge has erected a large screen in its newly landscaped gardens. There will be three additional screens in its Hangar Bar, so rest assured– if we find ourselves in the midst of an erratic downpour, we can continue to indulge in a heady Novak Djokovic-Carlos Alcaraz rivalry. Hackney Bridge makes for the perfect evening meeting spot: the space is home to a plethora of international food and drink traders, so with plenty of seating available, you can enjoy both a great meal and tennis. Notably, Pimms will be available by the jug.

## The Scoop

BEST FOR: UNINTERRUPTED VIEWS

A stone’s throw from Tower Bridge, The Scoop is a sunken amphitheatre right by the iconic spherical Norman Foster building that was until recently City Hall. If you’re heading into central London and are desperate to catch the tail-end of a Djokovic game whilst also enjoying a riverside view, The Scoop is your spot. If you’re planning on spending a bit more time around here, we would advise you to bring a cushion – the seating area of the amphitheatre is made up of stone.

## Spitalfields

BEST FOR: SOCIAL BUTTERFLIES

This outdoor screen is perfect for those looking to squeeze in a bit of tennis whilst heading West or before a post-work drink at one of Hoxton’s many bars. Pitched up right by the Old Spitalfields Market, Spitalfields bridges the gap between East End locals and freelancers from creative quarters like Shoreditch. There is a myriad of food and drink options ranging from food trucks to top-tier restaurants.

## Boxpark Shoreditch

BEST FOR: LOUD CHEERING

A regular haunt for sports fans in the East End, Boxpark Shoreditch’s offering of Wimbledon 2023 is certain to provide you with a high-energy, boozy viewing experience. With numerous food and drink options and multiple maxi screens, Boxpark sees a stream of young professionals from across London on the daily. It’s always busy, so be to check their socials beforehand and buy entry tickets if necessary.

## The Crown

BEST FOR: FAMILIES

Overlooking Vicky Park, The Crown is one of Bow’s finest pubs. With balconies and a small conservatory, enjoy Wimbledon as you enjoy the lush greenery of our favourite park. The Crown has multiple screens on both the ground and first floor, so no matter which nook you and your friends decide to settle in you will be able to catch some tennis.

## The Lord Napier Star

BEST FOR: MAKING A NIGHT OF IT

While [Hackney Wick](https://romanroadlondon.com/hackney-wick-bars-restaurants-raves/) has an abundance of bars, restaurants and breweries, from Howling Hops to [Barge East](https://romanroadlondon.com/barge-east-restaurant-hackney-wick/) floating on the other side of the canal – the Lord Napier Star is the area’s only pub. Not your traditional historic boozer, this lively modern pub is known for its colourful graffiti facade. The Lord Napier has a big projector downstairs as well as additional TV screens dotted around, serving up both Djokovic and local craft beers.

Wimbledon 2023 takes place from [3 to 16 July](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/65950710).
