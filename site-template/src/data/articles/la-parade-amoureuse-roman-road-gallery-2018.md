Last weekend, the talented dancers and performers of La Parade Amoureuse pranced down the Roman Road as part of the [Greenwich & Docklands International Festival](https://romanroadlondon.com/greenwich-docklands-international-festival/).

After weeks of anticipation, the dance troop made their way down the high street, some carrying amazing illuminated deer.

Social media was alight with feedback from locals – BBC and ITV2 presenter Jonny Nelson even caught site of the precession.

Bradley Hemming, art director and founder of the Greenwich & Docklands Festival, said he chose the Roman because it is a great venue for precessions: 'The long straight road gives such a perfect backdrop.'

Processions in previous years have included giant insects and giant puppets. One performance included interactions with [Roman Road market](https://romanroadlondon.com/market-archive-old-images-60s-70s-80s-90s/) traders.

We loved receiving all of your amazing photos from the evening, so it is thanks to our readers that we can share this gallery.
