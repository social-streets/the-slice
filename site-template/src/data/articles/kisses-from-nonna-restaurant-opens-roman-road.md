A new Italian restaurant and bar has opened at 387 Roman Road. Kisses from Nonna is open six days a week and offers a variety of authentic Italian cuisine.

The restaurant is run by Odette Gibson, who has been in catering for over 40 years, and her son Dominic. Her husband is Italian, and the family also runs the Angel of Bow pub in Bromley-by-Bow.

The space, formerly home of [Bacaro](https://romanroadlondon.com/bacaro-restaurant-review/), has been completely refurbished, with wallpaper designed by local outfit [Designer Wallpapers](https://www.designerwallpapers.co.uk/), and the eye-catching neon sign made by [The Neon Sign Store](https://www.neonsignstore.co.uk/) on Grove Road.

The restaurant does not have a set menu. Fresh produce is bought locally each morning and the day's menu is written up on a blackboard. Although highly adaptive, the menu strives always to celebrate the best of Italian cuisine.

‘Authenticity was important to us,’ Gibson said. ‘This is a real Italian, the food, staff, music, beer, wine, cocktails, everything.’ The Chianti is served in traditional raffia flasks.

The restaurant's name is a nod to the family's roots, nonna meaning grandmother in Italian. ‘We wanted it to show those qualities,' Gibson said. 'Homely, welcoming, good hospitality.’

Dishes include Gnocchi sorrentina, Salmone-all-Siciliana, and Scallopina-alla-Milanese, as well as wide selection of sides and deserts. The menu will change monthly to celebrate the cuisine of different regions.
