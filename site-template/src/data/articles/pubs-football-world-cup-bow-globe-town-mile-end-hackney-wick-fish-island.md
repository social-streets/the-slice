Where to watch the winter World Cup? We bring you the best pubs around Roman Road for the most dedicated football fans.

The first-ever World Cup held during our winter months, the World Cup 2022 is upon us. This year’s tournament takes place [in Qatar](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63554507) from 20 November to 18 December due to the country’s hot climate, and it looks rather different from what we’re used to.   

Rather than watching the game in the usual open-air fan parks and bustling beer gardens, there are plenty of pubs across Bow, Hackney Wick, Mile End and Globe Town pulling pints and pitchers to keep all you football fans well watered this winter. 

In fact, there are too many to choose from. To narrow it down, we’ve been pounding the pavements with a strict criteria in hand to find the best local pubs showing the games on at least two screens, projectors or more. 

## The Lord Napier Star

BEST FOR: POST MATCH CELEBRATIONS

While [Hackney Wick](https://romanroadlondon.com/hackney-wick-bars-restaurants-raves/) has an abundance of bars, restaurants and breweries, from Howling Hops to [Barge East](https://romanroadlondon.com/barge-east-restaurant-hackney-wick/) floating on the other side of the canal – the Lord Napier Star is the area’s only pub. Not your traditional historic boozer, this lively modern pub is known for its colourful graffiti facade, and has a packed weekly schedule of quizzes, DJs and curries. True to form, The Lord Napier is going all out for the football, showing the tournament on five screens and a massive projector, and offering four pint pitchers of Camden for £24 and 10 can buckets for £50. 

_Find the Lord Napier Star on 25 White Post Ln, E9 5EN._

## The Coborn

BEST FOR: FAMILY FRIENDLY VIEWING

The recently renovated [Coborn pub](https://romanroadlondon.com/coborn-pub-mile-end-reopens/) has all the hallmarks of an old East End pub of the early-20th century. Its mahogany panelled walls and ox-blood leather button-back chairs makes it the perfect setting for a more laid back, family-friendly football viewing. They will be showing all of the games across five screens but only the major matches will have the sound turned on. Perfect for appeasing football enthusiasts and those who are really just there for a pint. 

_Pop into The Coborn on 8 Coborn Rd, Bow, London E3 2DA._

## Little Driver

BEST FOR: GAMES & COMPETITIONS

![Little Driver Pub Bow beer garden.](/images/little-driver-bow-1024x683.jpg)

Possibly the most devoted sports pub of them all, Little Driver is bringing us every moment of live football action to Bow this season. With football quizzes, keepy-uppy games, and an ongoing competition to win free pints by guessing the winner of each match, Little Driver is football mad. A local face painter will even be at the pub for England’s first game against Iran. Often frequented by the local cat named … Little Driver’s two-tiered beer garden has private screens in every booth that can be booked ahead to watch the game in a little more peace. 

_Find Little Driver at 125 Bow Road, E3 2AN._

## The Approach Tavern

BEST FOR: OUTDOOR SCREENING

![Outside of the Approach Tavern, Bethnal Green. ](/images/Approach-Tavern-straight-on-1024x683.jpg)

Found in the shadow of Globe Town’s iconic [Cranbrook Estate](https://romanroadlondon.com/cranbrook-estate-in-pictures/), The Approach Tavern promises to fuel and ignite the passion of England supporters with their changing menu of real ales and good quality pub nosh. The tavern’s spacious front garden will be decked out with two screens, heaters and awnings, so the show will go on whatever the weather. Another three screens inside, the Approach Tavern is not taking any table bookings for England matches so we’d recommend settling in a few hours before the game to reserve your space. No harm having a few to calm the nerves while you wait. 

_Visit the Approach Tavern at 47 Approach Rd, Bethnal Green, E2 9LY._

## Rusty Bike

BEST FOR: HD VIEWING

![Rusty Bike pub and beer garden, Mile End Road.](/images/rusty-bike-pub-mile-end-1024x683.jpg)

If you never want to miss another football, rugby or boxing fixture then set up a bar tab at the Rust Bike in Mile End and get stuck in. This quirky and colourful sports pub will be playing Sky and BT sports coverage of all the World Cup games on six HD screens. Its red parasols are unmissable as you come out of Mile End tube station, covering its large outdoor seating area bustling with sports fans. If you get hungry at half-time, the Rusty Bike has an extensive menu of Thai food that comes highly recommended. Who doesn’t love a Pad Thai and a pint? 

_Pop into the Rusty Bike on 588 Mile End Rd, London E3 4PH._ 

## Green Goose

BEST FOR: CRAFTY COCKTAILS

![Goose Green pub on Anglo Road, Bow, with its doors closed.](/images/Green-Goose-Bow-save-community-pubs-1024x683.jpg)

If you’re after a slightly smarter spectator experience and would rather watch the World Cup while sipping on a lemon gin fizz rather than double parked with two pints of lager, then the Green Goose in Bow is for you. The Goose - as it is affectionately known by locals - has vast period windows that lend it a brightness lacking in some of Bow’s traditional local pubs. They will be rolling out plenty of TVs for World Cup season but we recommend booking in advance for England matches. If the rain holds off you might even be able to catch the game in the pub’s evergreen astroturfed beer garden. 

_Visit the Green Goose at 112 Anglo Road, E3 5HD._

## The Crown

BEST FOR: PARKSIDE PINTS

![Outside of The Crown pub, Grove Road.](/images/CROWN-NEW-1024x683.jpg)

If you haven’t visited the newly modernised [Crown pub](https://romanroadlondon.com/crown-pub-reopens-refurbishment/) since its renovation this summer, the World Cup is as good a chance as any to check it out (although it may take a bit more hustling than usual to get your orders in at the bar). Overlooking Vicky Park, the pub is only taking walk-ins for the games, so get there early to get a good view of one of the three screens downstairs. Make sure you don’t miss it though, the recognisable grey exterior has been transformed into a deep bluey grey. 

_The Crown is located at 223 Grove Rd, Old Ford, E3 5SN._

**England is in Group B, with its initial matches scheduled as follows:** 

21 November, 1pm: England vs. Iran

25 November, 7pm: England vs. USA

29 November, 7pm: Wales vs. England
