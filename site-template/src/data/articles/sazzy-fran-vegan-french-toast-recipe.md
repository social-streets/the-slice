Sazzy & Fran's vegan French Toast is a cruelty-free and extra delicious version of the classic sweet breakfast toast. It is also the dish that cafe co-owner Sarah Harrison - the Sazzy in Sazzy and Fran - missed the most when taking the plunge to go totally meat and dairy-free. We can't thank her enough for coming up with this vegan-friendly recipe.

For those who are not so familiar with this animal-friendly eatery on the Roman, everything in the [Sazzy and Fran cafe](https://romanroadlondon.com/new-sazzy-and-fran-vegan-cafe/) is vegan and almost everything is made in-house. The only products made elsewhere are the pastries, which are made by a vegan bakery in Hackney.

Their Instagram is pure food porn, full of colour-saturated images of vegan tacos, lasagne, home-made burgers, smoothie bowls, cakes and fluffy pancakes. The 6600 followers prove that this cafe truly knows how to do plant-based food.

The recipe uses stale bread, a great way to reduce your food waste.
