Whitechapel may be located in the gritty East End of London, but as you walk down the high street - if it weren’t for the grey skies - you could easily mistake yourself for being in Bangladesh,  breezing along Sylhet’s streets. 

Whitechapel High Street is in its own small bubble of South Asian culture. Just two stops from the booted and suited city workers of Liverpool Street station, it’s like transcending between continents when travelling from one to the other. 

Saree shops billow along the streets of Whitechapel, pleasantly catching the eyes of passers-by with their colours, like a rainbow emerging from the black sky of a storm. Their beads glisten from within the shop windows like the sun on the water of the Indian Ocean. 

Many of the owners don’t speak English, serving an almost exclusively Bengali clientele. So in some of the shops, you’ll have to communicate with gestures. 

Whether it’s Indian, Bangladeshi, or Pakistani dress you’re after, the South Asia of East London will save you a flight across the world, and bathe you in sarees suitable for every occasion.
