Channel 4’s Big Breakfast house in Fish Island has sold for 4.3 million pounds, but had to reduce its price by £1.4m nearly three years after it was first put on the market.

Lock Cottage, located in the shadow of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, first came on the market in October 2020, with the hefty price tag of £5.75 million. 

It is best known as the location of The Big Breakfast, the highly popular Channel 4 show which ran between 1992 and 2002. 

In recent years, a series of incidents, including an unexplained fire that destroyed a significant portion of the house, have resulted in the urban myth that the cottage is ‘cursed’. 

Perhaps, it is for this reason that the house has now sold for £1.4million under the asking price, almost three years after it first came on the market. 

This sale is significant due to the immense popularity of the Big Breakfast show, which featured many famous slots, including Paula Yates’ series of ‘On the Bed’ interviews.  

When the show was briefly rebooted in 2022, the new version was not filmed in the iconic Fish Island cottage. Instead, the rebooted show, hosted by AJ Odudu and Mo Gilligan, was filmed in the Villa Mansion in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire.
