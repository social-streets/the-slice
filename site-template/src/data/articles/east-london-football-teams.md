Football in Tower Hamlets isn't just a sport; it's a way of life. From our historic pitches to our plentiful and thriving local clubs, we have a rich footballing heritage that continues to shape our community identity.

Whether you are interested in five-aside, seven-aside, social teams, semi-pro leagues or teams focussed on positive mental health, Tower Hamlets won’t disappoint.

Even if you aren’t a football nerd, you will have heard of [Bobby Moore, and likely seen that iconic image of him holding up the World Cup](https://romanroadlondon.com/bobby-moore-footballer-east-end-roots/) in England's 1966 triumph. Moore, born and raised in the East End, continues his legacy at the Bobby Moore Academy in [Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/ten-years-on-queen-elizabeth-olympic-park/), nurturing the next generation of East London footballing talent and putting us firmly on the map.

It’s not only Moore who champions the ballers of the East End, as we have teams dating back to well over a century ago when ironworkers and dockers formed Millwall and [West Ham United](https://romanroadlondon.com/faces-west-ham-football-jose-da-luz-photoessay/). 

If you’re set on following in the footsteps of the greats or just keen to have a casual kick-about in one of the beautiful green spaces in Tower Hamlets, our guide to local men’s football teams gives you a round-up of which team might suit you, where to go and how to find them.
