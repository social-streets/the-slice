In the next instalment of **Tamsin Robinson**’s lockdown desserts, our resident Cordon-bleu pastry chef shares her recipe of sticky toffee muffins. All the ingredients can be found in the local food stores of the area. 

‘I’ve adapted the classic pud into a slightly lighter, muffin form that’s a little more fitting as we move into Spring,’ says Robinson. ‘I recommend making the sauce in advance (it can be kept in the fridge for 2-3 days) as it’s easier to handle when chilled.’

‘You can use it straight away if you are not able to make it in advance though. The recipe can also be made with gluten-free flour, but will need an extra 4-6 mins in the oven.’

#### Ingredients

_For 12 muffins_

Sticky Toffee Sauce  
100ml double cream  
60g salted butter  
60g dark brown sugar  
Muffins  
200g pitted (ideally Medjool) dates  
100ml boiling water  
1 tsp vanilla extract  
2 eggs  
160g dark brown sugar  
200g self-raising flour (or 200g plain flour plus 2 tsp baking powder)  
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda  
Pinch of salt  
1 tbsp vegetable oil

#### Method

**First make the sauce (at least 2 hours in advance, if possible):** Heat the cream, butter and sugar in a saucepan until everything has combined into a smooth sauce. Pour into a bowl and leave to chill in the fridge until needed later.

Preheat the oven to 175C fan, and line a 12-hole muffin tray with muffin cases.

Chop up the dates as fine as possible (I use kitchen scissors) and place in a large bowl with the boiling water.

Leave to soak for 2 mins, then mash well with a fork.

Add in all the other ingredients, and stir until everything is well combined.

Spoon 1 tbsp muffin batter into each muffin case. Then spoon over 1 teaspoon of the Sticky Toffee Sauce.

Divide the remaining batter between the 12 cases, covering the sauce as best as you can.

Bake on the middle shelf for 15-17 mins.

Leave to cool on a wire rack, and spoon extra sauce on top before serving.
