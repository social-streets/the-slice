Brixton Pizza has opened at 494-496 Roman Road (the former site of La Table Des Saveurs) offering authentic Neapolitan Pizza with a south Italian twist.

The new restaurant has a pizza oven, Italian wine, homemade tiramisu, and coffee from Salice Salentino, Italy, the hometown of one of the founders.

The first Pizza Brixton opened in February 2017, the creation of Cosimo Grasso, Zak Uddin, and Anis Rahman, who each have over 20 years experience in the restaurant industry.

'We are very excited to have opened our third restaurant on Roman Road, because of its wonderfully diverse and inclusive community.

'We truly believe food brings people together and is an essential part of special moments and memories. We would love to welcome everyone to enjoy our freshly made, hearty pizza and Italian comfort food with us.'

Most of the products and ingredients come from Puglia, a region in southeast Italy renowned for its wine and olive oil. Their pizza dough is 100% vegan.

The restaurant is open 11am to 11pm Monday to Saturday, and 11am to 10.30pm on Sundays. It also has the option of takeaway via [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/mile-end/pizza-brixton-bow?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=google_maps_link). 

It is the third restaurant in the chain to open, and the first north of the Thames. The other two are on St. John’s Hill and, would you believe it, Brixton.

The menu, which was created by Grasso, offers a selection of ‘verace’ pizzas, antipastos, and sides. The drinks menu includes wines, beers, cocktails, and softdrinks. 

The restaurant’s full menu can be seen [here](https://www.pizzabrixton.co.uk/Pizza-Brixton-menu.pdf). Visit the [Pizza Brixton website](https://www.pizzabrixton.co.uk/) for more information.
