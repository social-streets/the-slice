The former London Chest Hospital and St Peter’s Church in Bethnal Green are among ten sites facing decay and neglect according to Historic England.

Two historic buildings in Bethnal Green are at risk of serious decay and neglect, according to Historic England.

Despite Clarion Housing Group’s plans for the former [London Chest Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Chest_Hospital) to provide 290 affordable homes, the site has also been added to the list. 

The vacant hospital suffers from ‘water ingress, an issue caused by water leaking through its roof into the building.

Repairs were planned for the summer of 2023 and the Council is in discussion with Calrion regarding the future of the building.

St Peters church, built in the 1800s, has also been identified as a site at risk.

[The church](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/bethnal-green-churches-easter-services/) is built of flint facework on brick cores but its ceiling panels have decayed and fallen, causing asbestos contamination. 

Services are currently being held in a marquee in the churchyard while the church raises funds to deal with the asbestos problem and replace the ceiling panels. 

There are a total of 599 sites across London which have been flagged due to "neglect, decay or inappropriate development". 

East London is home to several sites deemed at risk, including the Grade I listed Church of St George in the East and the 15th century Upminster Tithe Barn.

The former Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel was taken off the at-risk register after undergoing a £125 million transformation, reopening as Tower Hamlets Town Hall.

Tom Foxall, regional director for London and the South East at Historic England, said: ‘In the 25 years of the heritage at-risk register, huge progress has been made in saving irreplaceable historic sites, and this year is no different.

‘Local communities are at the heart of finding solutions for heritage at risk and we are dedicated to supporting them so they can benefit from even more historic places being removed from the at-risk register.’
