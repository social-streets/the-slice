Italian bistro Bacaro makes some of the most delicious food on the Roman and now, you can recreate yourself. We persuaded them to share one of their secret recipes - the mouth-watering Truffle and Dolcelatte Arancini. Enjoy your own little taste of Italy at home.

#### Ingredients

Arancini

400 gm arborio rice 100gm finely grated parmesan 6 eggs lightly beaten Vegetable oil for deep frying 75gm plain flour, seasoned 100gm fine dried breadcrumbs

Truffled Dolcelatte Filling

100gm Gorgonzola Dolcelatte, coarsley chopped 15gm fresh black truffle, finely chopped

#### Method

Serves 4

Cook rice in a large saucepan of boiling, salted water for 15 minutes or until tender, drain well, place in a large bowl and cool. Add parmesan, two-thirds of the egg, season generously with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir to combine. Spread rice mixture on tray and refrigerate until cold.

For truffle Dolcelatte filling, place ingredients in a bowl, stir to combine, cover and refrigerate until needed.

To make arancini, place 1 tbsp of rice mixture in palm of hand and flatten with a spoon. Place ½ tsp of truffle Dolcelatte filling in centre of rice and gently form rice mixture around filling to create a ball. Transfer arancini to a large plate. Repeat with remaining rice mixture and filling. Makes about 24 arancini.

Place flour, remaining egg and breadcrumbs each in separate bowls. Roll each arancini gently in flour, dip in egg, roll in breadcrumbs and place on a tray. Refrigerate until needed. Heat vegetable oil in a deep saucepan or deep-fryer to 180C. Deep-fry arancini in batches for 3-5 minutes or until crisp and golden brown. Drain on absorbent paper and serve immediately.
