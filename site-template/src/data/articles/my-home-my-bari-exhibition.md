Walk into a 1970s British-Bengali home through the immersive My Home, My Bari exhibition created by local fashion designer, Rahemur Rahman.

In celebration of the 50 years of Bangladeshi Independence, Tower Hamlets Council commissioned acclaimed artist and British-Bangladeshi fashion designer, Rahemur Rahman, to create a collaborative and singular installation showcasing at the Kobi Nazrul Centre. 

The exhibition ‘My Home, My Bari’ aims to take its visitors back in time using smells, sights and textures to bring history to life through a representation of the living spaces of the community around Brick Lane in 1971, as conflict raged back in Bangladesh.

As part of the council’s series of [Bangladesh at 50](https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/leisure_and_culture/Bangladesh-at-50/Bangladesh-50.aspx) events, the installation was created as a result of the nine-month participatory project with artists, young people, and local business owners of the Brick Lane area.

Young people from the borough took part in summer workshops to create their own wallpaper which is part of the fabric of the artwork. Local business owners from the British-Bangladeshi community have also shared their stories as part of the wider project, which is displayed around the room of the exhibition. Read their [testimonial stories](https://www.mhmb.org/testimonials) through the My Home My Bari website.

Artist Rahemur Rahman said: “For several decades, Brick Lane and the surrounding area have been central to the diversity and dynamism of east London, as well as the evolution of a multicultural Britain.”

“My Home, My Bari is meaningful, evocative, hyperlocal and a brilliant way to encourage debate as well as connect audiences and communities who are currently excluded from meaningful participation in the arts.”

The exhibition will showcase from 26 November to 14 December at the Kobi Nazrul Centre, 30 Hanbury St, London E1 6QR.

Along with the installation, there will also be panel discussions and guided walks. For more information on the events and bookings visit the exhibition [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/exhibition-my-home-my-bari-tickets-203133356337).
