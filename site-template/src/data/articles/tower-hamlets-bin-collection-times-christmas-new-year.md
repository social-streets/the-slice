The council have announced when rubbish will be collected over the festive period across the borough.

The festive season is officially here, bringing all the cheer, celebrations and, of course, the chaos of cooking and gift wrapping. As the holidays approach, it’s easy for bins to fill up fast.

With this in mind, it’s important to stay on top of your bin collection schedule, as collection days will shift slightly across the borough during the Christmas and New Year period. Here's what you need to know to keep your waste under control this festive season.

The Council announced that all weekday collections will be a day later. For example, if you normally have your bins collected on Wednesday, they'll be collected on Thursday instead.

On Christmas Day, there will be no bin collection service across the entire borough. Those who normally have their bins collected on Wednesday will have their bins collected the following day (Thursday, December 26).

The same one-day delay will apply to Thursday, December 26 and Friday, December 27.

There will be a normal service on Saturday, December 28 and Sunday, December 29.

New Year's Day also falls on a Wednesday, with no collections that day. If you get your bins collected normally on a Wednesday, then your first bin collection of 2025 will fall on the following day, Thursday, January 2.

Bins will be collected one day later until Saturday, January 4 and residents can expect a normal service across the borough on Sunday, January 6.

The Council have also announced they can collect and recycle Christmas Trees in the first couple weeks of January 2025. If you have a food and garden collection, the council has said to make sure all decorations, lights and stands are taken off your tree and then leave it outside on the scheduled day.

If you don't get a food and garden collection and need to dispose of your tree or any other unwanted rubbish there is a Reuse and Recycling Centre on Yabsley Street in Canary Wharf. It is open every day except Christmas Day and has special hours of 9 am- 4 pm on Boxing Day and New Year's Day.
