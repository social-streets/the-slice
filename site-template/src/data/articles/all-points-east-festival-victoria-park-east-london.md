All Points East returns to Victoria Park in August 2023 with a strong set of headliners and supporting acts that will make this a summer to remember.

East London favourite All Points East has announced its return to [Victoria Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/) this August. The festival leads with some big names, including grime royalty [Stormzy](https://romanroadlondon.com/stormzy-all-points-east-headline-curate-2023/) and American indie rock favourite The Strokes. For local East Enders or those travelling halfway across the world to realise lifelong ambitions, All Points East in Vicky Park will provide the perfect setting to enjoy the music we love.

All Points East is spread across two weekends, first on Friday 18, Saturday 19 for Field Day and Sunday 20. There is a short gap until the bank holiday weekend when festivities resume on Friday 25, continuing on Saturday 26 and Sunday 27 and rounding off on Monday 28. ‘In the Neighbourhood’, All Points East’s free community programme, returns on Sunday 20 August and ends Wednesday 3 September.

## All Points East lineup

Here is the daily lowdown on the headliners for both All Points East and Field Day.

### Friday 18 Headliner: Stormzy's curated ‘This Is What We Mean’

By now grime star Stormzy has already secured his place in UK music heritage. From rapping in a South London car park with some friends before his hit song _Shut Up_ blew up, to headlining Glastonbury, Michael Omari has earned his stripes. After the release of his most recent album, _This Is What I Mean_ in November 2022, Stormzy became the first British rapper to have three number-one albums in the UK. 

To kick off All Points East Stormzy has curated a special roster of musical talent for Friday 18 August, taking from the name of his most recent album. ‘A summer thing, outside, for the people, always my people’– the ethos behind the day that will feature a wide selection of established and upcoming rap, hip-hop, grime and R&B. 

Artists to look out for are Kehlani, the Grammy-nominated R&B singer comparable to the likes of Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu; Sampha, whose poignant and soulful debut album _Process_ won the 2017 Mercury Prize; and North London’s Knucks, a rapper who has collaborated with the likes of Loyle Carner, Sainte and Stormzy himself.

### Saturday 19 Headliner: Aphex Twin to electrify Field Day

Aphex Twin or Richard David James is respected worldwide by all true electronic music heads. James’s mesmerising sounds range from the sublimely relaxing piano of ‘Avril 14th’ to the pulsating break-beats of ‘Vordhosbn’, often accompanied by cinematic music videos. Expect an entrancing audio-visual experience whether you are a grizzled dance music enthusiast of the 90s or a more recent fan of the genre. As a much-beloved musician who rarely takes to the stage, this set promises to be one to remember.

Other elusive, cryptic DJs also feature in Field Day’s roster. After years of being MIA, the widely acclaimed SBTRKT takes to the stage following the release of his widely anticipated album _The Rat Road_. The Mercury Prize-nominated Jon Hopkins– a frequent collaborator of Brian Eno–is also set to perform.

Bonobo stands as another act to look out for. Known for his atmospheric albums, such as _Cirrus_, Simon Green’s sounds will provide audiences with serene electronic beats to enjoy amid the crowd, or from a nice distance by the bar.

Other major performers include Arca, Fever Ray, Sudan Archives, Kelela and LSDXOXO.

This year’s Field Day explores the full breadth of electronic music, from ambience and Intelligent Dance Music to acid house and techno.

### Friday 25 Headliner: The Strokes play All Points East

The Strokes

American indie rock band The Strokes provide instant anthems that get people dancing. The band’s iconic debut album _Is This It_ was critically acclaimed and with good reason: The Strokes forged a new path in alternative rock. Their discography includes the number-ones _Last Nite_, _Someday_, and _Reptilia_.

Fellow New Yorkers Yeah Yeah Yeahs also feature on the bill. Led by fashion icon Karen O, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have a unique and powerful take on indie rock. Their discography includes the instantly recognisable track _Heads Will Roll_.

Another act to look out for is Angel Olson, an idiosyncratic singer-songwriter. Olsen flits between vengeful, head-bashing rock to the softer sounds of the track _Ghost On_ from her 2022 album _Big Time_. 

You won’t want to miss the indie-pop legend Girl in Red who is famous for her songs about the highs and lows of queer love. Another female-led act, the punk rock band Amyl and The Sniffers, also feature high on the bill.

### Saturday 26 Headliner: Jungle

For the release of their fourth album, Mercury Prize-nominated Jungle will take the reins on Saturday. Jungle– made up of West Londoners Josh Lloyd-Watson and Tom McFarland– present a blend of electronic, soul and funk, appealing to disco and house lovers alike. 

Saturday also features the iconic Erykah Badu, dubbed the Queen of Neo-soul. Her 1997 album _Baduizm_ is widely recognised as one of the most influential R&B albums of all time, bringing together R&B, jazz and funk topped off with Badu’s rich liquid vocals.

RAYE features high on the bill. RAYE is one of the most streamed artists in the world: the singer-songwriter’s take on pop has amassed over three billion streams. RAYE’s first independent album, _My 21st Century Blues_, was met with critical acclaim, with lead single _Escapism_ topping the charts in the UK. Rapper 070 Shake, who features on the aforementioned track, is also set to perform.

For more uptempo funk, jazz, house and electronic music, the lineup offers veteran DJ Folamour, The Blessed Madonna and the up-and-coming Nia Archives. 

Ragz Originale–the producer behind Skepta’s seminal grime album _Konnichiwa_, as well as of the exploratory and soulful sounds of FKA Twigz and SOPHIE– also takes to the stage, with his solo work rooted in R&B and soul.

### Sunday 27 Headliner: Dermot Kennedy takes the reins

Dermot Kennedy tops the bill on a Bank Holiday Sunday dedicated to singers and songwriters. Kennedy is known for his unique brand of melancholic contemporary folk music. The artist started by busking on the streets of Dublin and has since developed a sound that blends poetic lyrics with pop melodies. On a Sunday afternoon Kennedy’s set will bring in amiable crowds, young and old.

Sunday also features the powerful voice of Olivia Dean, whose music touches on R&B, pop, soul and jazz; Aurora, the Norwegian singer-songwriter known for her ethereal lyricism and soothing electronic rhythms and SG Lewis, the singer-songwriter/DJ who has worked with the likes of Dua Lipa and Tove Lo.

Other artists include James Vincent McMorrow; Nick Mulvey; Novo Amor; Moncrieff; Rachel Chinouriri; Aby Coulibaly; Aine Deane and Lexie Carroll.

### Monday 28 Headliner: HAIM leads billing of top female artists

Rock band HAIM closes the Bank Holiday weekend with a European-exclusive performance. Made up of three sisters, their nostalgic yet uplifting sounds are ideal for ending festivities on a high. The Grammy-nominated band gained fame with iconic songs _The Wire_ in 2013 and _Want You Back_ in 2017. Even Taylor Swift could not resist collaborating with the Californian outfit for the song _no body, no crime_, which became HAIM’s most streamed Spotify track.

Music royalty does not end there with pop icon Tove Lo sure to banish any Monday blues. Ethereal electronic music producer and DJ Avalon Emerson also never disappoints, having frequently played sets at Berlin’s legendary Berghain nightclub.

If that isn’t enough, you will also have the opportunity to see Snail Mail a.k.a Lindsey Jordan. Whilst Jordan’s music can be categorised as indie rock, her 2018 album _Lush_ is appreciated as a refreshing take on the genre, a marvel of songwriting and technical composition.
