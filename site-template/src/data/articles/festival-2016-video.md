Roman Road Summer Festival 2016 had everyone dancing in the streets as you can see in this lovely little video, made by local resident Roman Koblov.

A snap shot of the day, this video shows the crowds who flocked to the third Roman Road Festival and enjoyed shopping at the [Urban Makers East designer-maker fair,](https://urbanmakerseast.co.uk/) eating from the many street food stalls and being entertained on stage and street by local performers and entertainers including [Sunday Assembly East End](https://nationbuilder.sundayassembly.com/londoneastend_beginnings), Cameroonian singer and guitarist [Muntu Valdo](https://www.muntuvaldo.co.uk/), soul and funk band [Freddie and the Freeloaders](https://freddieandthefreeloaders.com/), rising stars from [ELAM](https://www.elam.co.uk/), Bangladeshi folk dance troop [Showmi Daz](https://www.showmidas.com/) and psychedelic dance troop[The Action Men](https://www.facebook.com/TheActionMen/).

The children had a lot of fun too with Pearly King and Queen craft stalls, Match Women hat making, magician [Professor Palmermoff](https://palmermoff.com/), the spectacular [stilt walkers](https://fipa.org.uk/), and cheeky turns from the Cockney Sparras and the Lady of the Mannah wiv ‘er best mate Doreen.
