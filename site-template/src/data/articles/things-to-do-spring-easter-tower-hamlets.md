From petting the newborn lambs at Stepney City Farm to foraging for wild food in Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park, make the most of the East End’s abundance of natural beauty this spring. 

After months of short days and inclement weather, springtime is officially upon us. Finally, we can look forward to warmer temperatures and more hours of much-needed daylight.

When the clocks go forward at the end of March, the sun won’t set until past 7:30 pm, opening up our evenings for more activities in the great outdoors.

For nature, this time of year heralds a burst of colour, from our flouncy pink cherry trees to crowds of daffodils, crocuses and tulips. You might also notice some new furry and not-so-furry friends coming out of winter hibernation, as many of our parks are home to frogs and bats.

For our different faith communities in Tower Hamlets, this is also a time of spiritual importance. Easter might be the most well-known celebration around spring, but April is also a significant month for several religious groups in the East End.

Sikhs will gather together for Vaisakhi, an ancient harvest festival signalling the beginning of a new year, on April 13. Meanwhile, the Jewish holiday of Passover, commemorating the exodus of Jews from slavery in Egypt, will commence before sundown on 22 April, and finish after nightfall on April 30.

And this year, Ramadan will draw to a close on April 9 and will be followed by Eid al Fitr, ending a month of fasting for Muslims.

Even if you don’t have a particular faith, spring is a time for personal reflection and goal-setting. We might be wise to take a leaf out of nature’s book, as countless species of plants renew themselves and bloom into a new era of life, right before our eyes.

Get the most out of this life-affirming season with our roundup of the best spring activities to do in Tower Hamlets.

Run, don’t walk, to Stepney City Farm, to catch the new-born lambs in all their pure and innocent glory. There’s something wildly beautiful about witnessing a creature experience the world for the first time, and these stumbling lambs are the epitome of hopeful life. This year, Stepney City Farm has welcomed five new arrivals - three rams and two ewes - to their flock of rare breed Manx Loaghtan Sheep. The first wide-eyed babies were born in mid-February, and the farm welcomed the last of its new furry residents at the beginning of March. Visit Stepneycityfarm.org for more information.

## Wandering and foraging in Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park

Tucked behind Mile End tube station, you’ll find a peaceful sanctuary of vibrant wildlife in our very own Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park. Take a slow, Sunday morning stroll through the cemetery’s historic, winding paths, and immerse yourself in the spring foliage.

The atmospheric woodland of pastel wildflowers and aromatic herbs is a forager’s paradise, but the cemetery’s grounds are far from a free-for-all. Before you pluck any cow parsley, wild garlic or snatch from the juniper tree, make sure to email or call the cemetery for permission. This way, the park can make sure certain rare plants aren’t over-foraged, damaging the biodiversity of the forest. Visit Fothcp.org for more information.

What says Easter more than a freshly baked, golden hot cross bun? Tower Hamlets is full of quaint cafes serving up homemade sweet treats and warming beverages, from The Coffee Room in Mile End to Loafing and The Breadery on the Roman. This Easter, we recommend pottering over to Poplar E5 Bakehouse next to Bartlett Park to sample one of their expertly-baked, sticky hot cross buns. But be sure to arrive at the bakehouse before noon, as the buns don’t hang about for long.

Victoria Park is beautiful in every season, but our local sanctuary of diverse wildlife is definitely at its peak in spring. You can already spot the flourishes of pink and white blossom covering countless trees, adding colour to their aged branches. If you happen to be about in the park this Sunday, the passionate dog lovers and groomers over at DogBliss on the Roman Road are hosting their first-ever Easter egg hunt, raising money for the Hungarian dog shelter, Kóborka. If you want to take part, bring your four-legged companion to the park and begin the search for an array of colourfully decorated eggs, especially scented to appeal to your canines. Each Easter egg will contain a token that can be exchanged at DogBliss for a dog-friendly prize. Visit Dogblisstheshop.co.uk for more information.
