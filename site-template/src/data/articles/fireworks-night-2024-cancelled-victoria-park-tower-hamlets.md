The display has been cancelled in previous years due to the spread of Covid-19 and because of budget cuts

Fireworks night has been cancelled at Victoria Park for the fifth year in a row.

A Tower Hamlets Council spokesperson confirmed to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) that there are no plans to host a fireworks display in Victoria Park or any of its other parks for 2024.

The last time the annual fireworks display took place was in 2019, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of the first moon landings.

[Other past displays have also been inspired by significant historical events and cultural moments](https://romanroadlondon.com/fireworks-victoria-park-tower-hamlets/) including the Great Fire of London, which was the theme in 2016, while 2018’s theme celebrated Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.

The displays, which take place on or around November 5 each year, have attracted large crowds of thousands of people in the past and were popular because they were one of the last fireworks events in London that remained free for people.

The Victoria Park display was cancelled in 2020 because of the pandemic, with the council stating at the time that it could not risk the potential spread of Covid-19 in large crowds.

The following year the council did not host the display because of budget cuts brought on after the pandemic, and firework displays were also cancelled for 2022 and 2023.

The council did not provide a reason why this year’s event has been cancelled again.

A council spokesperson told the LDRS: 'There are no plans for a fireworks display in Victoria Park or any of our parks this year.'
