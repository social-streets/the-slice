The council wrote it expects to see 'consideration of alternative scale and massing' of the potential new development in the City of London

Tower Hamlets council has warned a proposed new building up to 46-storeys tall could have ‘significant effects’ on the Tower of London World Heritage Site and Tower Bridge.

Tower Hamlets Council added it expects to see a ‘consideration’ of amendments to the size of the proposed 63 St Mary Axe redevelopment, ahead of an application being filed with the City of London Corporation.

Tower Hamlets’ comment was submitted in response to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Scoping Opinion report filed with the City. These are submitted as a precursor to the full EIA included as part of the planning application.

As detailed in the report, applicant AXA Real Estate Investment Managers UK is aiming to demolish the existing structures and construct a new mixed-use block up to 46-storeys tall. The site is currently occupied by two 1980s office buildings; 63 St Mary Axe, and Camomile Court.

The Corporation has approved the EIA Scoping Opinion, and as part of the planning process, a number of bodies were consulted on its contents. These included Historic England, St Paul’s Cathedral, and London City Airport.

The airport wrote its response would be an objection unless a number of conditions are applied to any planning permission, such as obstacle lights being placed on all corners of the building.

Tower Hamlets Council meanwhile raised concerns including the proposed building’s impact on the Tower of London.

The council wrote: 'Given the potential for likely significant effects on the Tower of London World Heritage Site and Scheduled Monument, and Tower Bridge Grade I listed building and their settings, LBTH expect to see consideration of alternative scale and massing of the Proposed Development.'

Commenting on its submission, a Tower Hamlets Council spokesperson said: 'The EIA process allows for alternative forms of development to be tested before a planning application is submitted. Our comments have suggested that this exercise should be carried out to inform the design of a tall building in this location so that it does not damage the wider setting of the Tower of London World Heritage Site and Grade I Listed Tower Bridge. Tower Hamlets has a statutory duty to safeguard these important heritage assets.'

A spokesperson for the development said: 'We are currently in the process of consulting with all relevant stakeholders to help inform our plans, for a best-in-class and highly sustainable office development at 63 St Mary Axe in the City’s eastern tall building cluster, which include enhanced urban greening and new public realm.'

Concerns about the impact of tall buildings in the City of London, in particular its ‘City Cluster’, on the Tower of London are not new. In response to the Corporation’s draft City Plan 2040, Historic England described the City’s policies as representing a ‘real threat’ to the Tower’s World Heritage Status.

Deputy Shravan Joshi, Chair of the Planning and Transportation Committee at the City of London, previously told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS): 'The City Plan sets out how we will deliver additional office floorspace up to 2040 at the same time as celebrating the City’s heritage. Recognising the exceptional significance of the World Heritage Site and the Cathedral, the Plan takes a bespoke and exhaustive approach to tall buildings and heritage. The policies in the Plan will ensure development protects and celebrates all our heritage assets while continuing to support the economic growth of the capital.'

UNESCO confirmed in July it has requested a report on the impact of the Corporation’s tall buildings policies on the Tower, to be submitted by the Government by December 1. This may then be examined by the World Heritage Committee at its 47th session in 2025, with the potential that the site’s UNESCO status could be removed.

The Corporation submitted the City Plan 2040 last month to the Secretary of State. It is now to be examined by the Planning Inspectorate with a series of public hearings to be held this winter. It is then anticipated to be adopted next summer.
