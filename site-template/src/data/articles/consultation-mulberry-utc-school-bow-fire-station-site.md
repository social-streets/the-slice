If you've been wondering about plans for the former Bow Fire Station that closed in 2014, you'll be interested to know that the Governors of Mulberry School for Girls in Tower Hamlets plan to open a University Technical College (UTC) on the site of the former Bow Fire Station on Parnell Road, just off Roman Road, in Bow, opening in September 2017.

### What is a University Technical College (UTC)?

University Technical Colleges (UTCs) are new schools for 14-19 year olds whose passions and talents lie in the practical application of their intelligence and creativity.  UTCs are led by universities and employers and give young people a huge advantage in their future careers.

### What will Mulberry UTC offer?

Mulberry UTC is Tower Hamlets’ first UTC, with specialisms in the creative, health and digital industries where local skills gaps and career opportunities lie. Partners include Goldsmiths University of London, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, National Theatre, British Film Institute and Barts Health NHS Trust.

Learning will be project-based, work-relevant and active. It will equip students with the academic, technical and creative skills and experience required by employers and open up secure progression routes into university, apprenticeship and skilled employment.  42% of students leaving one of the 39 existing UTCs in 2015 progressed to university compared with 37% nationally and 24% started apprenticeships compared with 8.5% nationally ([www.utcolleges.org](https://www.utcolleges.org/)).

When full, Mulberry UTC will have 800 students drawn from Tower Hamlets and its surrounding sub-region of central east London, with 200 in years 10 and 11 (14-16 year olds) and 600 in years 12 and 13 (16 to 19 year olds).

### What will Mulberry UTC look like?

Mulberry UTC has secured the site of the old fire station on [Parnell Road in Bow](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/64+Parnell+Rd,+London+E3/@51.5333991,-0.0283129,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x48761d3fab3d5267:0xee8f1b0b88a1a12d). Wates Construction Ltd have won the building contract and their architects, Scott Brownrigg, have submitted a [design proposal](https://www.mulberryutc.co.uk/where-will-we-be) to Tower Hamlets Planning Authority.

### When are the public consultations?

Mulberry UTC Trust is conducting a public consultation from 11 January 2016 to 19 February 2016 to explore the views of a wide range of people on the proposals for Mulberry UTC.

The findings of the consultation will inform the Secretary of State’s decision on the UTC’s future and will be used to develop the policies and practices of the UTC.
