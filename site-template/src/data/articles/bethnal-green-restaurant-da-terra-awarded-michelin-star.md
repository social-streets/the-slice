Bethnal Green restaurant Da Terra was awarded its first Michelin star this week, just nine months after opening. It is the only London restaurant east of Shoreditch that currently holds this accolade. 

Based in Bethnal Green’s Town Hall Hotel, the restaurant is headed by international chefs Rafael Cagali and Paulo Airaudo, of Brazil and Argentina respectively. The two met at Heston Blumenthal’s restaurant The Fat Duck in 2011.

Da Terra opened in January of this year, offering blind tasting menus that take inspiration from Cagali and Airaudo's time spent growing up in Latin America and working as young chefs in Italy and Spain.

Cagali said: ‘I am absolutely over the moon and couldn’t be prouder of our team. Everyone has been working very hard over the past few months and this really is a testament to their dedication and determination.’

Airaudo said: ‘I am so thankful to the Michelin Guide for recognising Da Terra and awarding them with a star. I feel very honored and am completely delighted for Rafa and the whole team.’

Da Terra can be found at 8 Patriot Square, London E2 9NF. The restaurant is open 6pm to 9.30pm Wednesday to Saturday, and midday to 2pm on Fridays and Saturdays. It also has a bar which is open Tuesday to Saturday.

The restaurant's interiors are  based on a contemporary colour palette of soft greys and teak wood, with open views into the kitchen. The walls often showcase selected works from young local artists.

Bethnal Green Town Hall has been home to several successful restaurants, one of which, Viajante, also won a Michelin Star back in 2010 when Nuno Mendes was chef.
