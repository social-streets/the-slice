The oldest printers in the East End, Arbers & Co on Roman Road, printed for the [East London Suffragettes](https://romanroadlondon.com/east-london-federation-suffragettes-established/) over one hundred years ago. In 2014, after 117 years in business, Arbers & Co closed their doors for the final time. 

Here Gary Arber talks to us about his Suffragette grandmother, the historic printing presses, the Krays, being Father Christmas for the children of the East End, and the glory days of Roman Road Market.
