With over 40 bourbons to choose from, and with a smoky American dive bar vibe, the latest edition to Roman Road, The Bourbon, opens its doors

With autumn firmly upon us, we can think of no better place to spend the darkening evenings than in an atmospheric American bourbon bar, right here on The Roman.

Mother and son duo Odette Gibson and Dominic Gibson opened up The Bourbon earlier last month.

As the name suggests, bourbon is the primary drink on offer with over 40 on the menu. Some range from £8, while others, such as rare and vintage bourbon, you can expect to pay £80 a shot. The bar’s manager, Dominic Gibson, explained that he has taken inspiration from American films and shows to create different bourbon-based cocktails.

Given the unique setting, you’d never know that The Bourbon was the site of the Gibsons’ former business, Kisses from Nonna. Gone is the Italian decor, and in with American Deep South vibes: the blackest of blue paint is thickly coated over exposed brickwork; blue velvet plush seating to help you ease into afternoon or evening relaxation; bourbon barrels for drinks bars, and wide wooden window shutters to give the bar an even greater feeling of warmth and intimacy.

To top this all off, there is an amazing collection of graffiti and street-art from London-based artist Paul Don Smith. Known for his multi-layered stencil artwork, he has carefully crafted a number of portraits from some of soul, jazz and rhythm and blues’ greatests, including Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday. 

The food menu fits in with the aesthetics and feel of the bar: bar snacks, which include smoked almonds, start at around £4. Small plates are around £8 and larger plates, which include beef brisket and duck, are at £12 to £15. And while this is a bourbon and smokehouse, it isn’t meat-heavy; there are a few options for vegetarians too, including a creamy sounding American Mac ‘n’ Cheese.

Despite having been open for only a couple of weeks, there has been a steady stream of customers, both from locals, and from those whose origins lie across the pond. If they approve, then so do we.

The Bourbon is open from 5pm to 11pm, Wednesday to Saturday, and 3pm to 11pm on Sundays.
