The proposed plans for a new student accommodation on an undeveloped plot of land on Brannan Street in Wood Wharf, have been rejected by the council.

Plans to build a 46-storey student accommodation tower in Canary Wharf were refused on Monday, November 25 over noise and anti-social behaviour (ASB) concerns.

The plans, from WW F1 Student Development Company Limited, were for a 912-student room student accommodation block on Brannan Street in Wood Wharf and had been recommended for approval by Tower Hamlets planning officers.

The student halls had been described in planning documents as of a ‘high quality’ and the building would have additionally included shops, a café space, a study space and gym/yoga studios.

During a Tower Hamlets strategic development committee meeting on November 13, the plans were deferred so a site visit could take place as some councillors had concerns over the size of the building and the potential problems with ASB.

Following the site visit which took place last week on November 21, the plans were presented to the strategic development committee for a second time earlier this week.

Planning officers went over the student management plan and said staff would be on site 24/7 and would be able to de-escalate any ASB and in severe cases of ASB, students would be evicted from their accommodation.

They said: 'This is a very different kind of student accommodation to your traditional concept of student housing, which you might think of with house parties and things like that, where it’s kind of a terraced house in a long line of terraced houses which are the ones to kind of develop ASB.

'This is a building which has been purpose-built and designed to be acoustically secure for residents of the building itself which also has the impact of reducing the amount of noise which can leave the building as well.'

He added: 'It’s a very different type of student accommodation, they have their own purpose-built amenity space within the building which they can use.'

When it came to the vote, Aspire councillors sitting on the committee were still concerned about the proposed location and were worried about potential ASB and noise pollution that could come from the student block.

The planning lawyer said if the plans were refused because of those concerns, it was very likely the developer would win an appeal with the Planning Inspectorate – which would leave the council with a ‘huge bill of costs’.

The plans were ultimately rejected as four councillors voted in favour of refusing the application, while the three councillors who voted in favour of approving the plans were outnumbered.

Paul Buckenham, who is head of development management, planning, and building control at the council confirmed the committee’s reasons for refusal as ASB concerns, noise and disturbance concerns that could come from late-night deliveries and 'lifestyle choices', the size of the development, the number of student bedrooms, and it being an inappropriate location for student halls.

The plans are now subject to a stage 2 referral with the Mayor of London who has the ultimate say on whether the council’s decision stands. The Mayor can also ‘call in’ the plans and take over the application.
