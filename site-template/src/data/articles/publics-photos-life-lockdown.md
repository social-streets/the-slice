If you could sum up your experience of Roman Road during lockdown in one picture, what would it be? 

Lockdown is slowly being lifted. Now that we are returning to a state of something resembling normalcy, we asked members of our local community to send in images summarising their experience of Covid-19. 

After all, our local area drastically changed for a period of time, whether it is closed public parks or socially distanced queues. 

Some of these images will be familiar to many of you. Signs of support for the NHS popped up on our social media circles; for instance, _those_ [signs on Grove Road](https://romanroadlondon.com/peter-liversidge-sign-paintings-nhs/) (which have since been taken down) and the expertly painted drive-way on Morgan Street. 

These images capture how our community came together in support of key workers and to show solidarity to one another during challenging times. 

Other images show how people's daily lives were impacted by lockdown, whether it is working from home or being unable to go for a daily jog in Victoria Park while it was closed.

Do you have photographs of your life in lockdown you’d like to add to this photo documentary? A buzz cut? Exercising in your living room? Please send to hello@romanroadlondon.com
