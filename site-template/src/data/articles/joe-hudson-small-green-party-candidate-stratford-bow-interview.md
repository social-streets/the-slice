As part of The Slice Tower Hamlets’ coverage of the 2024 general election, we interview Joe Hudson-Small, the Green Party candidate for Stratford and Bow. 

Joe Hudson-Small is the Green Party candidate for Stratford and Bow. We quizzed him on the party’s enormous public spending pledges, its plans to increase taxes by over £107 billion per year, and whether Tower Hamlets can afford to go green.

Originally from Worcester, Hudson-Small has lived in Newham since graduating with a degree in computer science from the University of Manchester in 2018. He was the first in his family to attend university and spent the next six years working in IT for both the public and private sectors.

A few years ago, he joined the Green Party during the campaign for the local elections in Newham. He said: ‘I helped out and we won our first Green councillors in the borough and became the first and only official opposition Labour had faced for over 16 years.’

He is co-chair of the Green Party’s Regional Council, representing all the regions of the UK at a national level. In May this year, he ran for City and East in the London Assembly Elections and was just 10 votes away from coming second place.

‘The Green Party were and are the only party to approach politics differently - to listen and consult with local residents while having the ambition to deal with the scale of the crises our communities and our world is facing,’ he said.

We asked Hudson-Small about his campaign to become MP in Stratford and Bow:
