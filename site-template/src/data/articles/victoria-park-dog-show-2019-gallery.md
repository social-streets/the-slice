The Victoria Park Dog Show is _the_ place to be seen in East London, if you're a dog. Every year pampered pooches rub shoulders with no-nonsense bulldog types, and it all winds up being rather pleasant.

We strolled up this year with honorary _Roman Road LDN_ mascot Rita the dachshund to experience [Vicky Park](https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/) at its doggiest. Plenty of old friends were there - [Cheeky Cockney Chris Kimberly and his Shih Tzu Skye](https://romanroadlondon.com/portrait-cheeky-cockney-life-after-being-postman/) and [Ryan Hodge of Woof Portraits](https://romanroadlondon.com/competitions/win-dog-woof-portrait-ryan-hodge/) among them.

All basked in the late summer sun and good vibes of the day. This photo gallery by Tabitha Stapely captures the event in full swing.
