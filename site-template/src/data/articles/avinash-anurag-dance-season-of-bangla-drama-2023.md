Part of the month-long Season of Bangla Drama, Avinash Anurag at the Brady Arts Centre shows the power of unconditional love for a child with special needs. 

On Saturday 18 November 2023, Aditi Roy’s Avinash Anurag, which translates to Eternal Love, runs at the Brady Arts & Community Centre. Roy wrote and choreographed the dance drama, drawing on her own experience raising her autistic son. 

‘I show the day of an autistic child. She’s not welcome, people don’t understand her behaviour,’ says Roy. She shows that ‘If you include the child, love the child, and accept her as she is, things will be very different.’

Roy wants the show to raise awareness about the challenges children with special needs face. She believes that a lot of these challenges come from a lack of awareness. 

The show is choreographed in Bharatanatyam style. The classical dance style originated in Southern India and is practised across the South-Asia. 

Avinash Anurag is part of the Season of Bangla Drama, organised by Tower Hamlets Council in partnership with Queen Mary University of London. Its theme of Love will resonate with everyone in the community. There are events every day till 26 November 2023. 

Tickets are £15 and doors open at 6.30 pm. For more information visit https://linktr.ee/aseasonofbangladrama.
