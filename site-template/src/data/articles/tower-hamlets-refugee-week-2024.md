In the wake of anti-immigration law demonstrations taking place across London, Refugee Weeks celebrates the strength of refugees

Refugee Week is a worldwide celebration of refugees' resilience, and several activities are taking place across Tower Hamlets this June in honour of refugees in our borough.  Refugee week is from the from the 17th to the 23rd of June.

Refugee Week is the world's largest arts and culture festival celebrating the contributions, creativity and resilience of refugees and people seeking sanctuary worldwide. Tower Hamlets has a line-up of its own, combining music events, film screenings and community food created by refugees. 

The Refugee Week festival is a partnership project that is organised by the charity [Counterpoints Arts](https://counterpoints.org.uk/). Counterpoints Arts in Hoxton is a leading national organisation in the field of arts, migration and cultural change. 

Every year has a theme, and this year's theme is called ‘Our Home’.

The week-long event connects people not only with in-person community activities but also raises awareness of refugees' struggles and empowerment through social media campaigns. 

Last year there were over 9,500 refugee week events in the UK alone and over one million people took part.

Established in 1998 in the UK, Refugee Week festival aligns with World Refugee Day, also celebrated globally on June 20th.

It is an international festival that will take place in over 10 countries including Australia, Germany, Croatia, Greece, Ireland, Jordan, Malta, Lithuania and Slovenia. 

Tower Hamlets has one of the most multicultural populations in the UK, making the celebration of refugee involvement in this area particularly pertinent. 

Here are some events taking place across Tower Hamlets that you can get involved in during (and in the lead up to) this year's refugee week: 

Azmari Bet at Rich Mix:

8 JUNE 2024 at 7pm

East London's Ethiopian community is creating an Azmari Bet x Refugee week special at Rich Mix at 35-47 Bethnal Green Road. An Azmari Bet is a traditional club found in the back streets of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. An Azmari Bet is typically held in a small, intimate setting, such as a local tavern or a specialised music house, where patrons gather to enjoy the performances. Audience members participate by making requests, offering tips, or engaging in playful banter. The performances can cover a wide range of topics, from personal anecdotes and love stories to social issues and political satire. The event aims to re-create an Azmari bet experience.
