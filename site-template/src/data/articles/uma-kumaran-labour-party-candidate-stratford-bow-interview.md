As part of The Slice Tower Hamlets’ coverage of the 2024 general election, we interview Uma Kumaran, the Labour Party candidate for Stratford and Bow. 

Uma Kumaran is Labour’s candidate for Stratford and Bow, a brand new, third constituency in Tower Hamlets. We quizzed Kumaran on whether Labour would stop arms sales to Israel, the environment, and more. 

Kumaran was born in East London, where her parents first settled when they fled the civil war in Sri Lanka. She credits a Labour MP for helping her parents when they moved to the East End and wants to give back to the community by standing for office now.

Kumaran completed an undergraduate degree in politics at Queen Mary University of London, before pursuing a master’s in public policy. She then became senior campaign adviser and then senior adviser to the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.

In September 2020, she was the deputy director of parliamentary affairs for Keir Starmer. Kumaran then became the director of diplomatic and international relations on behalf of the Co-Chairs of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. She is an advisory member of the Labour Climate and Environment Forum. 

We asked Kumaran about the most important issues facing residents in Stratford and Bow, and how she’d address them.
