The trial of nine Extinction Rebellion women accused of causing over half a million pounds of damage at the HSBC HQ in Canary Wharf protesting the company's position on climate change began this week

The trial of nine women from Extinction Rebellion accused of causing over half a million pounds of criminal damage by breaking windows at HSBC HQ in Canary Wharf in protests of the company's position on climate change began Monday at Southwark Crown Court.

On Monday the jury trial began at Southwark Crown Court. 

The nine women standing trial are Jessica Agar, Blyth Brentnall, Valerie Brown, Eleanor (Gully) Bujak, Clare Farrell, Miriam Instone, Tracey Mallaghan, Susan Reid, and Samantha Smithson. Their ages range from 23 to 71 years old.

All have pleaded not-guilty. If found guilty they could face a maxim sentence of up to four years in prison.

They are standing trial for causing over half a million in damages at the HSBC HQ when they broke windows during a protest. 

The nine women wore patches reading ‘better broken windows than broken promises’. Then placed stickers on the windows of the bank reading ‘£80 billion into fossil fuels in the last 5 years’. They then broke the glass windows with hammers and chisels.

Afterwards, they sat down and waited for the police to arrest them.

They staged the action in protest of HSBC's activities and investments that contribute to climate change.

This style of protest is part of Extinction Rebellions' belief in using public acts of non-violent civil disobedience.
