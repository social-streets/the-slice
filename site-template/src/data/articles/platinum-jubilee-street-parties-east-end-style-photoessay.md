Take a look at last weekendâ€™s Platinum Jubilee celebrations around the Roman, full of cake, bunting, music, drinks and smiles.

Queen Elizabeth II has officially made history. She has become the first UK monarch to reign for seventy years on the throne, something few are ever likely to witness again. Here in the United Kingdom, we know how to celebrate such an achievement, and around Roman Road is no exception.

Over the [jubilee weekend](https://platinumjubilee.gov.uk/events/), our neighbourhood was decorated with bunting and streamers, the road lined with tables, chairs, and matching napkins and tablecloths. Music and laughter filled the air, as residents of all ages headed out for some cake, dancing and fun with neighbours.

It is hard to believe that post-lockdown we would be here, celebrating with friends. But the loneliness we have all experienced over the last few years in isolation is a distant memory. Seeing the smiles and joy in our neighbours' faces makes the struggles over the last two years worth it. Queen Elizabeth II has served us all, as Queen of the United Kingdom and through unifying us all in celebration.
