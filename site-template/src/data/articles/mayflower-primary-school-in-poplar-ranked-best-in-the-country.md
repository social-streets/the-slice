**Poplar’s Mayflower Primary School has been ranked as the best primary school in the country by The Sunday Times.**

Mayflower Primary School in Tower Hamlets has been recognised as the best primary school in the country in The Sunday Times Parent Power League Tables 2023.

This follows Mayflower’s success of being named The Sunday Times Primary School of the Year in 2021 and featured in the top three in 2022. 

Queen Elizabeth II visited Mayflower in 2017 to commemorate the bombing of the school during World War 1, which killed 18 children.

Mayflower achieved the best Standard Assessment Tests (SATS) results amongst all 1,500 state and independent primary schools surveyed by the Sunday Times across England.

The Sunday Times Parent Power survey analysed the top 250 primary schools across the independent and state sectors in England.

It ranked them by the aggregated average scaled scores achieved by children in reading, grammar, and mathematics from SAT tests taken in 2019 (results released in 2020).

Three other Tower Hamlets primary schools were also ranked in the top 100 primary schools in Greater London.

Dee Bleach, Headteacher at Mayflower Primary School, said: “We were delighted to hear the news. Our success is due to how everyone works together at Mayflower, we really are a community school and my thanks go to everyone who is part of our school community.”

Lutfur Rahman, Mayor of Tower Hamlets congratulated all the Tower Hamlets primary schools who have been recognised in The Sunday Times 2023 league tables.

“Tower Hamlets prioritises children’s education and has excellent schools, with 96% being rated Good or Outstanding by Ofsted. These results are a credit to the education staff and pupils who work hard every day to achieve admirable outcomes,” said Rahman.
