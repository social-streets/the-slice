The plans by the NHS property service were drawn up alongside Barts Health and the Queen Mary University of London, and are being approved after negotiations about the public benefits of the development

A new development in Whitechapel is set to become a ‘world class’ hub for life sciences which could go on to create over 4,000 jobs after the Council approved the plans. Five new buildings are to be built on land next to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, while a sixth building which already exists on the site and provides specialist HIV services is to be retained there.

Life sciences is the study of living organisms and life processes and is relevant in multiple areas such as biology, genetics, cell biology and neurobiology. The plans, which were approved by the council last week (October 9) but still need final approval by the Mayor of London, are from the Department of Health and Social Care, supported by NHS Property Services and will see nearly 70,000 sqm of floor space dedicated to life sciences.

There will also be community spaces that can be used by residents and local schools as well as a café, public toilets and a brand-new public square. The plans had previously been deferred so councillors and planning officers could visit the proposed site after concerns were raised about the daylight and sunlight impacts the buildings could have on residents living nearby as well as needing a better understanding of the public benefits.

During a meeting with the council’s Strategic Development Committee last week, councillors heard how the scheme could provide up to 4,180 full-time end-phase jobs of which 1,045 have been set aside for Tower Hamlets residents. The Department of Health and Social Care has additionally pledged to create 61 construction-phase apprenticeships for residents and a minimum of 20 end-phase apprenticeships.

Planning officer, Gareth Gwynne said: 'Members set out in the last committee that they wanted to understand better the public benefits of the scheme and expressed concerns around those including the level of apprenticeships. I’m pleased to report that the applicant has addressed that with the securing of end phase apprenticeships which wasn’t previously proposed.'

Also included in the plans are a new life science research and teaching building for Queen Mary University of London and an on-site school community lab which will give students and teachers first-hand experience of life science activities. As part of financial contributions, £1.7 million will go towards employment skills and training while £2.5m will go towards community health and wellbeing projects.

The £2.5m was initially worded in planning documents as ‘wellbeing, women’s health and community health research’ however the committee’s chair, Amin Rahman, asked for this to be ‘worded more flexibly’ and changed to ‘community health and wellbeing projects’. Cllr Mufeedah Bustin challenged this, however when it came to the vote she was outnumbered by five councillors who were in support – Cllr Rahman later said the money would still be going towards women’s health.

Cllr Bustin said: 'I’ve been reflecting on this application since the last meeting and think I was really moved by the speaker who talked about the life expectancy of women in this borough – I agree that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Tower Hamlets and specifically the women of Tower Hamlets as well.

'£2.5m towards women’s health is a drop in the ocean and I just can’t understand the reasons for watering that down and taking it away from 50per cent of the borough’s population, but that is for others to argue.'

Cllr Rahman said: 'I really like the application, I’ve done a site visit as well. I think it’s a beautiful opportunity in our borough and I do feel my heart is towards this application with my amendments because I feel like these amendments are quite fair. Obviously I don’t see I’m being too hard with these amendments, \[with\] the £2.5m I get it my colleague has questioned me on it but it will be towards it.'

The plans saw five councillors vote in favour of the development, while two councillors abstained meaning the vote was carried and the plans were ultimately approved. Tower Hamlets Mayor, Lutfur Rahman, later said in a statement: 'This is a boost for Whitechapel and the latest in a series of developments in the area that is putting Whitechapel on the map as a go-to area of London.

'The development will benefit local people now, with the creation of job opportunities, but it will also be a boost for the future. If our young people can see a world-class facility on their doorstep, it will help inspire our next generation of scientific talent.' The plans will now be referred to the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan before a final decision is issued.
