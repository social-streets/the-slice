DLR workers will strike next week in a dispute over pay with no service expected across the DLR on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The DLR will see two days of strike action on Tuesday 7th November and Wednesday 8th November in an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions after a pay offer was rejected by union members. 

If strikes go ahead, Transport for London doesn't expect any service across the DLR network.

Transport for London also warns some services might be affected on the morning of Thursday, November 9th.

Transport for London advises: “If travelling on these days, you should plan ahead, check before you travel, consider alternative routes and allow more time for your journey.

The London Underground, [Elizabeth Line](https://whitechapellondon.co.uk/elizabeth-line-history/), London Buses, and other London transport are not on strike and so unaffected. However, Transport for London says it may be busier than normal. 

Striking staff are members of RMT (The National Rail, Maritime and Transport Union) employed by KeolisAmey Docklands. They manage and run the DLR on behalf of Transport for London. 

The strike comes after members who work on the DLR rejected a below-inflation pay increase. The offer was a 4.75% pay rise, plus a one-off taxable £1,000 cost-of-living payment. 

RMT members have been carrying out ongoing industrial action nationwide in disputes over pay and working conditions.
