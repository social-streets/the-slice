The proposed redevelopment of 1-2 Minster Court has brought up concerns that the Tower of London World Heritage Site could be threatened

The Government’s heritage body has warned a potential new office block by The Walkie-Talkie building could impact historic sites including the Tower of London. Historic England wrote that the proposed redevelopment of 1-2 Minster Court, which is set to be 115 metres tall or around 23 storeys, would likely ‘be visible across a large area and could, as a result, affect the significance of heritage assets at some distance from this site itself’.

The Council raised concerns that the potential scheme could also impact the nearby Tower Bridge by blocking views of the iconic landmark.

The letters were responding to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Scoping Opinion filed on behalf of property investor M&G Real Estate. These are submitted as a precursor to the full EIA included as part of the planning application, which a spokesperson for M&G Real Estate said is expected in 2025.

The site is currently occupied by two buildings that are 13 and 10 storeys tall respectively. According to the report, the proposed project would involve the partial demolition of the existing buildings to be replaced with the new development.

It is anticipated to deliver 65,000 square metres of office and cultural/education/amenity space. A series of public realm improvements are also planned, including a public roof terrace. Roughly 60 per cent of the existing primary structure will be retained in a bid to reduce carbon emissions.

The site sits within the City’s Eastern Cluster, an area designated as appropriate for tall buildings. The Gherkin, The Walkie-Talkie and The Cheesegrater are among those located nearby. As part of the consultation for the EIA Scoping Opinion, Historic England and the Council were approached for feedback.

In the council’s response, it wrote: 'Given the potential for likely significant effects on the Tower of London World Heritage Site and Scheduled Monument, and Tower Bridge Grade I listed building and their settings, LBTH expect to see consideration of alternative scale and massing of the proposed development.'

It added that there would be a series of potentially significant effects on Tower Hamlets borough, including on views and townscape, and noise and air quality. Historic England similarly raised concerns about the potential impact on the Tower of London.

The heritage body wrote: 'This development could, potentially, have an impact upon a number of designated heritage assets and their settings, in the area around the site including the Tower of London World Heritage Site. In line with the advice in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), we would expect the Environmental Statement to contain a thorough assessment of the likely effects which the proposed development might have upon those elements which contribute to the significance of these assets.'

London City Airport requested a condition be added to any planning permission stipulating obstacle lights be placed on all corners of the proposed building due to its potential height, to avoid any danger to aircraft. Other consultees approached included Westminster City Council and Transport for London (TfL).

A spokesperson for M&G Real Estate said the company has a 175-year history developing and retrofitting sustainable office buildings, and that its plans for Minster Court balance sustainability goals with the site’s heritage while also supporting the City’s economic aspirations.

They said: 'We are considering the future of 1-2 Minster Court to meet sustainability targets and occupier needs, engaging with the City of London and stakeholders. The City’s EIA Scoping Opinion, now under review, will help inform any future application.

'Comments from London City Airport regarding safeguarding are standard for developments of this height, and we expect to meet all conditions. In terms of heritage, we have already engaged with conservation officers, and future applications will include comprehensive heritage assessments. We are committed to minimising impacts on nearby historic assets, including the Tower of London.

'We are consulting on proposals to transform 1-2 Minster Court into sustainable office space, with a planning application expected in 2025. We remain committed to creating a sustainable future for the site and look forward to continued dialogue with heritage groups and stakeholders to ensure the project reflects the values and aspirations of the community.'

Tower Hamlets Council and Historic England filed similar responses to an EIA Scoping Opinion detailing plans to demolish 63 St Mary Axe and build a mixed-use block up to 46 storeys tall. Earlier this year, the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) revealed how Historic England had described the City of London Corporation’s tall building policies in its City Plan 2040 as posing a ‘real threat’ to the Tower of London’s World Heritage Status.

UNESCO, which oversees the designation of such assets, confirmed in July it has requested a report on the impacts of the Corporation’s tall building policies on the Tower, to be submitted by the Government by December 1. This may then be examined by the World Heritage Committee at its 47th session in 2025, with the potential for the site’s UNESCO status to be removed.

The Corporation’s City Plan 2040, which will act as its steer for future development of the Square Mile, was submitted to the Secretary of State in August. It is now to be examined by the Planning Inspectorate, with the expectation it will be adopted next summer.
