As of Saturday (Jan 11th 2015), St Paul's Church on Roman Road has a new vicar in the young Reverend James Hughesdon.

Rev. Hughesdon, 32, and his wife Caz have a home in St Stephen's Road and have lived in east London since 2007.

He served for the previous two and half years as Curate in the same church before becoming its vicar. Bishop of Stepney Adrian Newman led the well-attended ceremony. The Archbishop of Canterbury authorised James' appointment personally, a rare occurrence in the administration of the church.

Rev. Hughesdon said:

> 'I am looking forward to working with the church and the local community to continue to see this area and people's lives transformed. Roman Road has always had a reputation as a lively, vibrant place and I long to see it and those who live here flourish and grow through encountering God and one another.'

The official title of the parish of St Paul's church is St Paul & St Mark, Old Ford. It spans from Driffield Road in the west to the Olympic Park stadium in the east and serves about 15,000 people, according to the church.

St Paul's was without a vicar for 18 months. It was reopened in 2004 after lying derelict for 13 years. It is now an award-winning building which hosts a thriving events space for people of “all and none” faiths in Bow. Recently it was host to the [Roman Road Winter Festival's Winter Warmer gig](https://romanroadlondon.com/winter-festival-winter-warmer-gig "Winter Festival: Winter Warmer music and festive action").
