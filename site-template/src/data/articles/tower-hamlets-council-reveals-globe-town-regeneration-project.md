A £1.67 million fund could mark big changes for Globe Town, with flagship proposals of revamping [Globe Town Market Square](https://romanroadlondon.com/rediscovering-globe-town-market-square/) and opening up a second railway arch to better connect the area with the Queen Mary University London campus to the south.

Funding for the programme was confirmed in July. Key proposals include: 

- **Opening up a second railway arch** so students and staff at QMUL can access the neighbourhood via Meath Gardens. [Friends of Meath Gardens](https://romanroadlondon.com/friends-meath-gardens-mile-end/) campaigned for this move [last year](https://romanroadlondon.com/friends-meath-gardens-underpass-petition/), arguing it would drive more customers to Roman Road.
- **Revamping the market square.** New seating, lighting, planting, and equipment will be installed for [Globe Town Market](https://romanroadlondon.com/globe-town-market/) traders, hopefully encouraging more stalls to join [Herbert’s Fruit and Salad](https://romanroadlondon.com/herberts-fruit-and-salad-globe-town/), [Downey Brothers fishmongers](https://romanroadlondon.com/downey-brother-fishmonger-globe-town-market-roman-road/), and [Fuller’s plants](https://romanroadlondon.com/plant-stall-globe-town-market-square/). 
- **Replacing metal shutters with open grills.** Old-school metal shutters on shop fronts will be replaced by open grills. More than a few pieces of [shutter art](https://romanroadlondon.com/shop-shutter-art-gallery/) will be lost, but it is hoped that the extra light on the high street will deter vandalism.  
- **Converting lock-ups into workspace.** Underused space near the square will be repurposed in order to increase workspace available in the area.  
- **Cosmetic changes** like new signage, planters, and street art on the sides of housing blocks will also be incorporated into the scheme.

These proposals for Globe Town regeneration fit into a wider push to improve high street life in the Bethnal Green Ward, the council having supported the launch of the [Roman Road Borrow-a-Bag scheme](https://romanroadlondon.com/roman-road-to-launch-borrow-a-bag-scheme/) earlier this month. 

Bethnal Green councillor Sirajul Islam said: 'Rejuvenation of the Market Square is important to the local economy as well as attracting students from the nearby Queen Mary University. Opening of access through Meath Gardens from the university is an important element of this success.

'I am confident that the money will be well spent as lots of thoughts and ideas have been developed through engagement of local people, local businesses, community organisations, and other local stakeholders.'

The full Globe Town regeneration plans will be displayed at 189 Roman Road on the following dates:

- Friday 1 November, 2pm to 4pm
- Tuesday 5 November, 2pm to 4pm
- Saturday 9 November, 12.30pm to 3.30pm

The displays are a chance for locals to view the plans and make their own suggestions for improving life on Roman Road West and the surrounding area.
