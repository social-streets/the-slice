Spanish beach-bar-style cafe Chiringuito opened yesterday in Bethnal Green's Museum Gardens.

Founder and Director, Alex Dehayen, first had the idea to open a bar in 2010 when he came across a disused kiosk in Bethnal Green Gardens. After struggling with planning arrangements, the council suggested he use the building in Museum Gardens instead.

Dehayen won the lease for this building in 2015 and got the keys in January 2017. The external walls of the original building are the only part that remain.

Dehayen gutted the interior and rebuilt it glass panels for extra light and a view onto the gardens. Now, the building features a roof terrace where you can enjoy your food and drinks, offering a relaxed atmosphere, similar to the Chiringuito bars of Barcelona.

As the sole owner, Dehayen was able to have control over the building works. His professional background is in property renovation, leaving him well-equipped for the job.

To devise the menu, Dehayen worked with a Peruvian chef on a selection of dishes. He says, 'We wanted to make sure there was a range of dishes that meant everyone could eat with us.' The menu ranges from small plates to larger meals and the prices reflect this.

Dehayen recommends trying the Seabream in Passionfruit sauce with Peruvian chillies... yes please. If you like a cocktail with your dinner, Dehayen suggests you try a [Chirinjito - their take on a Mojito](https://romanroadlondon.com/chiringuitos-cocktail-recipe-chirinjito-mojito/) with damson jam and a splash of Cava. Or, if you like to keep it simple, try a specially brewed Chiringuito lager from the nearby Truman Brewery.

A full breakfast comes in at around £10, while an Empanada (similar to a Spanish pasty), will only set you back £3.50. Head down to Museum Gardens and satisfy your Spanish cravings.
