In recent years East London's Bow and Roman Road area have seen an explosion of housing developments. Like it or not, the property developers have arrived and the area is changing fast. Here's an updated list of developments clearly illustrating the 'Bow Boom' in the last two years, including a few that are still in the pipeline.

## New housing developments in Bow, East London

The map shows the new housing developments being built in Bow East, Bow West, and also within a 10 minute walk of the Roman Road high street including parts of Fish Island, Globe Town, the eastern reaches of Bethnal Green, and northern reaches of Bromley-by-Bow.

The colour red represents the private housing developments that have been built in East London's district of Bow between 2010 and 2015; a total of 13 developments. An astonishing 10 of those 13 development have appeared in the last two years - the 'Bow Boom'.

The colour purple shows the private housing developments built in the five years previous to that (eg 2005-2010); a total of five. The blue and green colours represent developments built before 2005; just three.

The 13 housing developments that have been built in the Roman Road catchment area in the last five years (including those due to complete this year) have brought circa 1,674 new households to the area. This unprecedented population growth is sure to see significant change in the local shops and services along Roman Road.

It's a time of great opportunity, but vigilance is also needed to ensure our heritage and history are protected; that architectural designs contribute positively to the local landscape; that promised Section 106 money is put to good use for the community; and that the developments are affordable, well-built, and provide a suitable mix of one and two bedroom apartments, as well as larger four and five bedroomed housing for families.

With more developments on the horizon, including the former fire station on Parnell Road, should local residents be consulted on big planning decisions that would have a significant impact on local life? [The Localism Bill of 2010](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/5958/1923416.pdf "Link to Government document about Localism Bill 2010") introduced the concept of neighbourhood planning. Is this something you would welcome for Roman Road and Bow?
