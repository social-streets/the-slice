Whether for Shrove Tuesday or anytime you need a carby treat, here are the best places in Bow for pancakes, from thick American drop-scones and French crêpes to Turkish Gosleme.

When life gives you lemons, what do you do? You pile on a heap of sugar, of course. 

A delicious tradition, this year, Pancake Day (or Shrove Tuesday) will fall on Tuesday 13 February, around a week earlier than last year, teasing us with the anticipation of its golden brown fried goodness. 

Whether you prefer sweet or savoury, American or crêpes, indulging in pancakes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner is an annual must.

They are easy to [whip up at home](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/food/recipes/a531992/how-to-make-pancakes/), but sometimes life is just too short, and if your flipping skills aren’t quite up to scratch and you can’t bear the idea of scraping pancakes from the ceiling, never fear, as we have a stack of local spots near Roman Road that will cater for any craving.

## Cafe Creme

Let’s talk breakfasts, oh, and pancakes. You can find Cafe Crème on the corner, nestled next to the [Bow Library](https://romanroadlondon.com/vernon-hall-old-bow-library/). In this cute cafe, among the multitude of breakfast offerings, including waffles and spicy vegan bean burgers, you will find what today is all about: the pancake. 

They will serve you up a heap of homemade pancakes with all the classics, including lemon and honey, Nutella, bacon and maple syrup, all topped with a scoop of ice cream and a flavoured drizzle on top; how decadent.

_Find Cafe Creme at 566 Roman Rd, E3 5ES._

## Awen

BEST FOR: HEARTY PLATES

At the heart of Roman Road is Awen, a cafe & bistro whose name means “inspiration” in Welsh, Cornish and Breton.

It's a great option if you fancy big, fluffy American-style pancakes. On their daily menu, they have three options. The American comes with two pancakes, two free-range eggs, bacon, Cumberland sausage, hash browns and beans: it’s like breakfast on breakfast. The Canadian, if you fancy your eggs scrambled, and if veggies are your thing, then the Vegetarian American pancakes boast a hearty plate of pancakes topped with veggie sausage, hash brown, portobello mushroom, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and beans.

Did we mention all pancakes are served with a heap of mixed berries, seasonal fruit, and maple syrup?

[Mae + Harvey](https://romanroadlondon.com/mae-and-harvey-cafe/) always seem to go all out on Pancake Day. A firm favourite on the Roman Road, Mae & Harvey put on imaginative annual specials. This year’s Pancake Day menu will feature deliciously delicate crêpes topped with a creative savoury option of mushroom and gruyere cheese, with the addition of ham for the non-veggies. Their sweet twist to tantalise the taste buds is lemon curd and rhubarb… don’t walk, run.

_Mae & Harvey is located at 414 Roman Rd, E3 2RZ._

## Loafing

BEST FOR: FRENCH CREPES

A key pancake day stop on Roman Road is Loafing, a leafy French bakery with a handful of outdoor seating on the corner, perfect for watching the world go by. Along with delicious coffee, their thin, delicate, and delicious crêpes are mouth-watering and not to be missed. Those desiring a sweet treat on pancake day will not be disappointed. 

Choose from a variety of classics, lemon and sugar, piles of chopped strawberries, maple syrup and, of course, pancakes with a hearty dollop of Nutella.

[Cafe East](https://romanroadlondon.com/cafe-east-reopens-after-refurb/) is a real favourite on Roman Road. Their daily queues snaking outside the door is a sure sign of getting things right. From the fruity pancakes to the sumptuous-sounding waffles, the food bursts with colour just like their tropical, leafy interior. 

Everything is made fresh, and the dessert pancakes are served with piles of exotic fruits. The Pancake and Berries option came highly recommended as a firm customer favourite, Nutella being a strong indulgent runner-up.

Those who lean toward the savoury can opt for scrambled eggs, streaky bacon, Cumberland sausage, two hash browns and beans…and fresh green juice for good measure.

## Zealand Cafe

BEST FOR: CHOICE OF TOPPING

Parked on a corner of Roman Road is Zealand, a cool daytime cafe with exposed brickwork, wooden floors and a glorious smell of fresh speciality coffee. Priding itself on cakes fit for royalty and simple home-cooked food, its daily menu has five types of pancakes to choose from. 

If you venture out in the morning, then the Breakfast Pancake is a firm choice. Two homemade pancakes loaded with scrambled eggs, crispy bacon and fruit; what a perfect way to start the day. 

For something sweeter, we think the Classic Berry sounds delicious, tempting you with heaps of berries and swirls of whipping cream. If the menu wasn’t enough, they have a large pile of fresh Gözleme stuffed with spinach and cheese on the counter, which offers yet another option to satisfy your pancake desires.

Although not strictly a pancake, a Gözleme is a savoury, buttery Turkish stuffed turnover that we think will scratch that savoury pancake itch. Tucked inside Niyazi Usta Artisan Bakery, next to Akdeniz Supermarket, you will find handmade Gözlemes freshly made. Did we mention they come at a very reasonable price?

The Gözleme fillings range from minced meat, spinach, cheese and potato, they are sure to make a really hearty lunch. This bakery, which is owned by their neighbours Akdeniz, sells a range of produce, including Turkish pastries, baked every day in the supermarket next door’s large, subterranean bakery, which sits beneath the shop floor.

_Artisan Bakery can be found at the end of the Roman, on 67 Usher Rd, Bow, E3 2HA._

## Sweet Talkers

BEST FOR: SUGARY TREATS

Choose from a whole host of tempting-sounding toppings, from Ferrero & Nutella to fresh and fruity Strawberry & Mango. For a real treat, you can have a Cinnamon Crêpe served with Butterscotch sauce, a scoop of pistachio ice cream, chocolate shavings and crispy wafers, finished off with a swirl of whipped cream. 

They pride themselves on healthy cooking and try to minimise the additives in their food…your Pancake Day never felt so good.

_Visit Sweet Talkers at 633 Roman Rd, Bow, London E3 2RN._

## Sazzy and Fran

BEST FOR: A SWEET TOOTH

Heading toward Bethnal Green underground, you will find Sazzy and Fran.

The cafe is owned by two friends, yes, you guessed it, Sazzy and Fran, who came together in 2015 over their mutual love for plant-based goodness, coffee and a healthy side of friendly cafe culture.

The cafe started with humble beginnings in a shipping container, but now, as a permanent fixture on Roman Road, it offers a lunch menu that they can deliver by bike to groups of five or more.

Sazzy and Fran is a must on this day of indulgence; those with a sweet tooth will not be disappointed. The menu features fluffy American-style vegan berry pancakes piled high with banana, nutty granola, maple syrup, coconut flakes and a sprinkling of cinnamon. For the chocolate lovers, treat yourself with peanut butter, banana, nutty granola and lashings of chocolate sauce, with optional whipping cream.

## Jungle Electric

BEST FOR: FUN ALTERNATIVES

A bit of a wild card as they aren’t strictly serving pancakes for eating, more for having fun with, so, if you love pancakes and hate Valentine’s Day, then Jungle Electric is the place for you.

As an anti-Valentine’s Day special to their weekly drag night, Queenie Quiz, they will be serving up drag queens, games and special pancake-flipping realness. Expect (inedible) pancakes plastered to the ceiling and prizes for the fastest pancake race…you’ve got to be in it to win it.

_You can find them at 467 Roman Rd, Bow, London E3 5LX_
