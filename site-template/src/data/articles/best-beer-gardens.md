We have rounded up the best pubs with outdoor seating around Roman Road reopening their outdoor spaces this week.

We’ve all been anxiously awaiting the reopening of pubs gardens, and are thrilled the time is finally here. Having suffered so much this past year, we are so thankful to see that so many of our favourites have weathered the storm to get back to pulling pints.

So do away with those sorry cans, put on your favourite sunglasses, and slap on some sunscreen up for what’s sure to be an outstanding pub garden summer.

To aid you in your planning, we’ve rounded up a list of perfect spots to grab a pint in the British sun. From snug walled gardens to ingenious pavement pitches to sheltered (and heated!) booths, in the East End you'll find pubs with outdoor seating to suit whatever the British weather throws at you.

We’ve even included some useful info for those four-legged members of the family – they can’t be left at home now can they?

Off the beaten track off Old Ford Road, close to Victoria Park and the canal, you’ll find this award winning pub. It's worth seeking out for the quality of its beer alone. The Eleanor Arms boasts four handpumps serving Shepherd Neame ales and regular guest beers. As well as a sun-trapped beer garden, The Eleanor Arms boasts a pool table and large screen for major sporting events, perfect for when you’ve had a bit too much sun. Fingers crossed Thursday quiz night will return.

Due to their perfectly pint-sized outdoor seating area, the Eleanor Arms are pretty booked up during their first week of opening, so booking in advance is essential.
