Starting in 2025, authorities will charge all drivers a toll for using Blackwall Tunnel and the nearby under-construction Silvertown Tunnel.

From 2025 all drivers will be charged a Blackwall tunnel toll to repay the costs of the under construction Silvertown tunnel in Newham. 

Blackwall Tunnel connects Poplar to Greenwich and is the only major crossing of the Thames in East London.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has confirmed that drivers will be charged a Blackwall Tunnel toll. However, there is no confirmation yet of a specific charge.

Last month documents submitted regarding signage suggested the toll could be £4. However, in a letter sent to Transport Secretary Mark Harper last week by Mayor Khan, a £5.25 charge was mentioned. This was because when factoring in inflation since the £4 charge was first suggested, the equivalent today would be £5.25.

Mayor Khan has also written to the government saying he is considering a low-income residents discount for the charge. 

The toll intends to repay the nearly £2 billion cost of the Silvertown tunnel, as well as cover maintenance and repair.

The Silvertown tunnel is currently under construction between Newham and Greenwich. It is expected to open in 2025.

Mayor Khan has stated that both tunnels would require charging to prevent drivers from congesting just one non-tolled tunnel.

The original suggestion to toll both crossings came when Boris Johnson was Mayor of London. It was approved by Prime Minister Theresa May's government in 2018.

As Poplar drivers know, Blackwall Tunnel faces regular closes and serious traffic especially during rush hour. TfL data shows there were 2,767 closures of the Blackwall tunnel in the previous 12 months. Equalling almost 12 days of closure.
