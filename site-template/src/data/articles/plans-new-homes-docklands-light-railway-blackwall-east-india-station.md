The new development was given the green light despite concerns affordable housing would be in close proximity to a busy railway track.

Plans for 150 new Poplar homes from developer Naval Row Freehold Limited were approved by Tower Hamlets Council last week, despite concerns affordable housing would be ‘right up against’ a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) track.

Last week, [Tower Hamlets Council’s](https://romanroadlondon.com/tower-hamlets-council-misrepresent-tfl-position-liveable-streets-ltns/) strategic development committee granted planning permission for some 169 new homes to be built in the shadows of a DLR track in Poplar.

The tower blocks will be part-10, part-20 and part-30 storeys high and will tower over a DLR line connecting Blackwall and East India stations, while eight office space units are to be built beneath the track.

Of the 169 homes, 69 would be one-beds, 72 would be two-beds and 28 would be three-beds. The development would deliver 36 per cent [affordable housing,](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/tower-hamlets-council-block-aberfeldy-new-village-flats-redevelopment/) split into 39 affordable rented units and 13 intermediate units.

A “multi-functional” youth play space will be built, as well as a new bus loop that will go through the site.

However Cllr Mufeedah Bustin of the [Labour Party](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/tower-hamlets-mayor-local-election/) said she was concerned that the affordable housing would be built closest to the DLR track.

Cllr Bustin said: “My main concern is about the affordable housing and it being so close to the DLR.

“I wonder whether there’s any further information on the internal layout so that we can get some assurance that it’s not going to be bedrooms that are right up against the DLR – or if there’s any sort of conditions we can put in place in order to minimise the impact on people’s sleep and well-being?”

Planning officer, Victoria Coelho who was presenting the planning application, then said: “It’s worth noting that the units that face onto the [DLR](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-london-64571705) are dual aspect so it won’t be their only outlook.

“Regardless of tenure I completely appreciate your concerns in terms of the quality of the units, especially in the affordable – but they have been tested and they will all be of a satisfactory quality. “

During the consultation stage in March 2022, 604 planning letters were sent out to nearby homes however the developer received no representations from residents.

The plans also received no objections from the DLR, however, the Housing and Safety Executive (HSE) raised some concerns about the development only having one single staircase which would be accessed by both residents and firefighters in the event of a fire.

In response to fire concerns raised by HSE, plans have now been changed to include another staircase.

After they discussed the planning application, the council’s strategic development committee proceeded to the vote where seven members voted in favour while one member abstained from the vote.

Planning permission was then agreed and the applicant, Naval Row Freehold Limited had its planning application granted.
