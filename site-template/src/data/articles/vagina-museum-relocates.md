Bethnal Green is home to many museums: V&A Museum of Childhood, The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, and Museum of the Home. And now it can add to its list, The Vagina Museum.

The world’s first museum dedicated to all things gynecologically focused, [The Vagina Museum](https://www.vaginamuseum.co.uk/) will open its doors on its new premises in Bethnal Green on 19 March. 

The museum initially started as a pop-up series of events in 2017, eventually opening a fixed address in Camden Market. In its time at Camden Market, it welcomed more than 150,000 visitors and hosted exhibitions such as _Muff Busters: Vagina Myths and How to Fight Them_ and _Periods: A Brief History._ 

Two years after opening in Camden, the museum’s team started to look for a larger site to expand its collection, offerings and space. 

Its new home on Victoria Park Square, Bethnal Green, is three times larger than its previous one. The museum will re-launch its exhibition _Periods: A Brief History._ Alongside extra space, it will hold a café, rehearsal rooms, a performance space, and a co-working space.

The museum’s founder and director, Florence Schecter, said: ‘We’re thrilled to be able to reopen our doors to the public.’ She added that while the last few months have been tough while the team has searched for a new home, they are ‘excited to become part of the vibrant community in Bethnal Green.’
