Open House Festival is an opportunity to discover architectural and housing gems in Tower Hamlets that are normally hidden from view, from residential grand designs to social housing and ancient churches.

Open House has selected 41 locations to visit within Tower Hamlets this year. These are our highlights of the events running from Wednesday 6 - Sunday 17 September and some information on our borough.

Around eight million people have attended the Open House Festival since it was launched in 1992, making it the world’s largest celebration of special buildings and neighbourhoods. 

The fortnight-long programme of tours and events showcases our area’s most spectacular housing, architecture and landscapes. From historic churches and walking tours to community-based buildings, find yourself intimately exploring our borough in all of its architectural wonder.

Perhaps you’ve peered into these buildings and wondered what was on the inside, or maybe you’ve always been curious about certain historical spots. Either way, this is the perfect opportunity to get a sneak peek.

The new headquarters for the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Council is situated within the [former Royal London Hospital building](https://romanroadlondon.com/tower-hamlets-town-hall-moves-whitechapel-former-royal-london-hospital/).

St Margaret’s House offers events and opportunities all year round, working with Tower Hamlets Council to provide a Creative Health Zone in East London. Its story stretching back to 1888 is admirable. Initially called the Bethnal Green Ladies Committee, St. Margaret’s House progressed to helping nearby parishes in Sunday School and training medical and social workers. Now owning a beautiful cafe, and charity shop and running well-being creative sessions, its aim is to create a space for all creatives in East London.

## St Paul's Bow Common

Widely regarded as the most significant post-war church in Britain, this spot is definitely worth checking out. The original grand and lofty Victorian Gothic version of St. Paul’s was destroyed during the Blitz. The new brutalist design built in the 1950s expresses the radical ideas that were emerging from architectural discussions of the time. Before heading out there, you may enjoy these [old photos of a wedding](https://romanroadlondon.com/east-end-wedding-st-pauls-bow-common/) held in this church back in the 1970s.

Four Corners Film Workshop opened in 2007 with an aim to create a unique facility supporting the artists, photographers and filmmakers of East London. Inheriting a dilapidated building, architects came up with a design to match their vision, creating a central courtyard ‘hub’ allowing light and air to filter through the building.

After decades of closure, falling into disrepair and undergoing extensive restoration work, the church was reopened in 2019 and renamed The Heritage & Arts Centre Bow.
