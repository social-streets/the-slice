December is around the corner, which means that the run up to panic buying last minute bubble bath sets is upon us. 

However, our well-loved festive tradition of Christmas shopping will be slightly different this year. Swarming sardines trekking through Oxford Street is off the cards. We will be ‘adding to cart’ and ‘continuing to checkout’ instead. 

As well as a surge in online shopping, Covid-19 restrictions have increased our reliance on the local high street too. We have understood the importance of community by striving to look after each other. Shout out to all the [local shops](https://romanroadlondon.com/shops-open-for-business/) who pivoted their business by offering takeaway services.

We thought that we would create a guide for how you can do both this Christmas. You can push beyond the boundaries of Amazon and Asos by making a local shop-owner do a happy dance. 

From sustainable hand-crafted candles to crates of East London distilled booze, the gifty treasures of our small businesses are only a click away.

To tick those boxes of originality, thoughtfulness, beauty and meaning, here’s how you can #shoplocal from your sofa and make a loved one smile. There is something for everyone right here on our doorstep.

## **Gift shops**

### SNAP

Roman Road’s hot pink hub of happiness is currently operating as an online store. It’s the perfect spot for gifts, summed up by Helen the owner as ‘nice things by nice people’. Do you know a baby that was made in E3? There’s a babygrow for them. Do you know someone who is proudly East London? There’s a sweater for them. Does your crazy cat friend need a ‘cool cats’ puzzle’ in their life? Well, they have that too. Have a browse [here](https://www.snap-store.com/).

### Ánimo Yoga

You may know ánimo yoga as the beautiful wellbeing studio nestled in the heart of Roman Road. If you have peeped through the pastel green window frame, you might have noticed their delightful gift shop. They stock unique, vibrant and ethical yoga outfits, by brand ‘Puka Wear’, that will make your yogi friend stand out through any vinyasa flow. From jewellery and candles, to locally made ceramics, everything in this shop will make a gorgeous gift. Check out their [online store](https://animostore.co.uk).

### Urban Makers Pop-up

Urban Makers is the ultimate online Christmas market. With a rooted belief in nurturing creative people with unique dreams and ideas, it is a colourful platform that showcases original products and inspiring designers.

From recycled cashmere gloves and vegan diffusers to ethical statement jewelry, they have an eclectic range of sustainable gifts. Have a wander around the virtual market place [here](https://urbanmakers.co.uk/christmas-pop-up/).

### Sublime

There’s one word for this gifty Vicky Park Village store: sublime. Fittingly, that’s what the shop is called too. Whether you’re looking to buy a mate a mug with a funny caption (a trusty classic), or treat someone special to a luxuriously organic cotton garment, this is the place for you. Despite having to shut shop during this second lockdown, they will still be operating via local delivery (within a mile radius) and click & collect. Simply choose delivery or pick up at checkout. Have a scroll through [here](https://www.sublimeshop.co.uk/). If you have any questions, feel free message the team on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sublime.ldn/).

### Branch on the Park

Branch on the Park is a local jewellery shop. You’ve probably been mesmerised by the diamonds that gleam from their Victoria Park Village windows. Julia is the talented owner, and she undertakes all of the shop’s private commissions. By skillfully matching precious metals with unusual gems, her creations have an exotic feel. From sparkling birthstone bracelets, to glistening pendants, a present from here would make an extra special gift. Make your loved one sparkle this Christmas.

### Whitechapel Gallery 

Don’t you love popping to an art gallery and having a browse in their shop? Picking up a pretty postcard, or perhaps a funky pencil, is a novelty we have missed whilst their doors have been closed. But, did you know that Whitechapel Gallery’s items are available to look at online? Their chunky portfolios of contemporary art and exhibition catalogues will have any coffee table looking adequately bougie. You can pre-order by emailing mailorder@whitechapelgallery.org to collect your gift, or have it delivered, when it reopens after lockdown. Visit their online shop [here](https://shop.whitechapelgallery.org/).
