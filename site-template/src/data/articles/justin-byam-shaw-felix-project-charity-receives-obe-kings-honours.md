Charity recognised for its work rescuing and redistributing nearly 30 million meals for vulnerable Londoners.

The Felix Project's founder Justin Byam Shaw was awarded an OBE for his charity's service to the London community in the King's New Year Honours in January 2023. 
  
Poplar is home to one of The Felix Project's four depots, including the newly founded Felix’s Kitchen with a facility of 4087 square meters - making it the first of its kind operating on this scale in London. Founded in 2016, the organization not only distributes food but also prepares thousands of meals for those in need. Three other depots can be found in Deptford, Enfield, and Park Royal.  
  
Poplar’s branch of Felix Project and Felix’s Kitchen opened in the summer of 2021 in response to the increased need caused by the COVID-19 crisis. From its professionally equipped kitchen, volunteers delivered meals to the elderly, homeless and others in need using 42 vans across the streets of East London, one of the most deprived areas struggling with food poverty in London. Despite being a new kid in the block, nearly 2.8 million meals were delivered since its launch.  

In 2021 alone, the organization rescued and redistributed from its four depots and new kitchen nearly 13,000 tonnes of surplus food, producing nearly 30 million meals, an increase of over 70% since 2020, according to [the charity’s impact report for 2021.](https://thefelixproject.org/uploads/files/Felix-Project-Annual-Report-Feb-22-v6-DIGITAL.pdf)

“I know it is customary to say this sort of thing, but the truth is that this honour reflects the work of our staff and 1,500 volunteers who feed 400,000 Londoners in need every week,” he said to The Independent.  

This is the charity's second OBE award as Mr Byam Shaw’s wife, Jane, was awarded an OBE in the Queen’s birthday honours list in June 2022.
