Animal Welfare Party and East London Dog Community are protesting against the council's proposed restrictions on dogs in public spaces- including Victoria Park. 

A peaceful protest will take place from 6 pm on November 20 outside Tower Hamlets Town Hall against an off-lead dog ban for the borough. 

Organised by the Animal Welfare Party and East London Dog Community, the protest will coincide with the council meeting at 7 pm to discuss the petition held against the proposals. 

The council are currently consulting on plans to introduce a borough-wide Dog Control Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO). 

The PSPO is aimed at promoting safe interactions between people and dogs in shared public spaces. 

Proposals include requiring dogs to be kept on a lead in all parks, including Victoria Park and open spaces, restricting dogs from un-gated children’s play areas and sports zones, and limiting dog walkers to four dogs at a time.

Jane Smith, Deputy Leader of Animal Welfare Party said: ‘The most restrictive of these plans have the potential to severely impact dog welfare by limiting access to off-lead exercise, play and species-specific behaviour for the thousands of dogs living in the borough.

‘At the same time, the overall perception of dogs could be negatively impacted and community relations strained.’

Both organisations are united in concern over the potential negative consequences for dogs, people and the wider community. 

In response to the proposed PSPO, the recently formed East London Dog Community expressed support for three out of the five measures being considered.

They back restrictions on dog fouling, the requirement for dogs to be kept on a lead when directed by an official, and the exclusion of dogs from certain gated areas, such as children’s play parks.

However, they argue that the remaining proposals are ineffective, disproportionately impactful, and likely to create more problems than they solve. 

They highlight that the issues these measures aim to address will be displaced to other areas, rather than resolved.

Bernadette Moriarty, spokesperson for East London Dog Community said: ‘For many, including elderly and disabled people, dog walks aren’t just exercise: they’re a lifeline. 

‘We want to find a solution that supports the many benefits of dog ownership while resolving dog-related anti-social behaviour by targeting the source of the problems: a small number of irresponsible owners.’ 

The protest plans to have around 40 residents and many dogs present.
