A Hackney Wick resident has been charged with fatally stabbing [Trei Daley](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-64615885), 26, in Queen’s Yard, a busy nightlife area.

Police were called to an East London hospital at around 4.30am on Saturday 11 February, after two people were brought in with stab wounds.

Daley, of Bromley in South London, was one of the men treated but died in hospital from a chest wound, a post-mortem examination on Tuesday February 14 reveals.

Christopher Appiah-Blay, 35, who lives on Wick Road, was arrested on Tuesday for the murder on White Post Lane. He was further charged with possession of an offensive weapon and appeared at Willesden Magistrates' Court hours after his arrest.

On Monday, Detective Chief Inspector Jim Eastwood of the Met’s Specialist Crime Command said: ‘Officers have already spoken with a number of people who were in the area, and I am grateful for their assistance.'

The second man, 24, was discharged later on February 14 after his wounds were treated.

Tributes for Daley were paid at Bromley’s Blackheath Park yesterday, with friends and family coming out in force to honour his memory.

Anyone with information or any witnesses who are yet to speak with police are urged to call 101 quoting CAD 1222/11Feb.
