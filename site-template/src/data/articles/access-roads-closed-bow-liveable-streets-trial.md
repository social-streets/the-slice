Road closures and vehicle restrictions on Coborn Road, Antill Road, and Tredegar Road will be trialled from Saturday 13 July to Sunday 21 July. 

A bus gate will be in operation on the stretch of Tredegar Road between Fairfield Road and Parnell Road, meaning only buses will be able to pass through between 7am and 8pm every day. During this time traffic coming off the A12 into Bow will only be able to travel down Fairfield Road towards Bow Road.

The stretch of Coborn Road running between Malmesbury Road and Tredegar Road will be closed to motor vehicles 24/7. Cyclists and pedestrians will not be affected.

These are two of several road layout changes being trialled by [the Liveable Streets programme, a £3.3 million fund intended to transform the transport infrastructure and public spaces of Bow](https://romanroadlondon.com/tfl-plans-3-million-transformation-bow-roman-road/).

The trial will be used to assess the impact of vehicle movements and rat-runs in Bow and the surrounding area.

Reducing traffic on Coborn Road and St Stephen's Road have been some of the most common suggestions on [the programme's interactive map](https://www.pclconsult.co.uk/liveablestreetsbow/) since phase one of the scheme began in April.

The following road layout changes will be trialled in Bow between Saturday 13 July and Sunday 21 July:

- Coborn Road will be closed to motor vehicles between Tredegar Road and Malmesbury Road
- A bus gate, which allows only buses to pass through, will be in place on Tredegar Road between Fairfield Road and Parnell Road operating from 7am to 8pm every day
- Antill Road will be closed east of the junction with Lyal Road
- Anill Road will be made two-way between Selwyn Road and Lyal Road
- Tregedar Road banned right turn into Coborn Road will be removed

Drivers have been encouraged to make journeys on the A road network during the trial period. Traffic management signs will be placed around Bow to minimise disruption.

A survey will run concurrently with the trial so locals can provide feedback. This can be found at [the official trial page](https://www.pclconsult.co.uk/bowtrial).

Visit the [Liveable Streets: Bow project page](https://www.pclconsult.co.uk/liveablestreetsbow/) to add your suggestions to the interactive map. Although the window for initial feedback has closed you can still email [liveablestreets@towerhamlets.gov.uk](mailto:liveablestreets@towerhamlets.gov.uk) or call 020 3092 0401.
