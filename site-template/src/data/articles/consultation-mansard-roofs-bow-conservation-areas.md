Local residents have been invited to comment on supporting evidence which could lead to mansard roofs being permitted in conservation areas of Tower Hamlets, including Bow. A consultation meeting for Bow residents will be at St Paul's Church, St Stephen's Road, this Thursday 3rd December at 2-5pm and then on Friday 11th December at 5.30-8.30pm.

Conservationists feel that the uniform terraces of conservation areas should be preserved, thus protecting East End and Victorian heritage. Yet others argue that the lack of four bedroom housing in areas such as Bow is forcing families to leave and that permitting mansard roofs would help retain a healthy mix of ages in the borough. What do you think?

Full correspondence from the Council can be read below and here is their [Mansard Roof Guidance Note published by London Borough of Tower Hamlets, November 2015](https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mansard-Roof-Guidance-Note.pdf)
