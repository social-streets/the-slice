As the needs in our community sadly, continue to grow as the pandemic places more pressure on all levels of society, your appetite to help those in need has not abated. Here's our COVID-19 Community Guide for lockdown #3.

It includes how you can reach out to your community and help those in need.  And because times are admittedly tough - whether you are old, young, a business owner, or a resident - please remember to take care of _yourself_ as well. And you can find out how here, as well. 

We can see the light at the end of the tunnel so stay strong Roman Roadies. This page is part of the Roman Road Covid-19 Help Hub.
