Celebrating one year since its inaugural edition, the next issue of Tower Hamlets’ only independent free magazine is now available at stockists near you.

The third edition of _The Slice_ is now available across Tower Hamlets, published by Social Streets C.I.C., the not-for-profit digital media company that publishes Roman Road LDN. 

The print magazine is the same brand of community-centred news and culture that is published online at Roman Road LDN, showcasing content from all four of Social Streets’ platforms in Tower Hamlets: [Roman Road LDN](https://romanroadlondon.com/), [Bethnal Green LDN](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/), [Whitechapel LDN](https://whitechapellondon.co.uk/) and [Poplar LDN](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/).

As a social enterprise, Social Streets uses journalism to strengthen the community by exploring ideas around home and identity and helping people connect with each other.

> We focus on constructive journalism that shows both sides of the argument and tries to find solutions to local issues.  
> 
> Tabitha Stapely

Social Streets’ founder Tabitha Stapely said: ‘We believe [cultural heritage](https://romanroadlondon.com/local/culture-heritage/heritage/) is the glue that holds a community together so a lot of our work is long-form documentary style articles that explore the lived experiences and memories of diverse people from our community.’

This issue of _The Slice_ is a Christmas special packed full of recommendations for the best places to eat, shop and visit this festive season. 

In the spirit of the late [Queen Elizabeth](https://romanroadlondon.com/queen-elizabeth-visiting-east-end/), the magazine focuses on unity with stories from the local area that show solidarity in the face of adversity. 

These include how Repton Boxing Club has provided an inclusive space for the marginalised, how the Friends of Joiners Arms campaign group has turned adversity into an opportunity to unite the LGBTQ+ community, and how a simple sewing machine has united generations of a family forging a new life in our borough.

As Stapely said: ‘Compared to more conventional local newspapers that have a more sensationalist and often inflammatory approach to news, we focus on [constructive journalism](https://romanroadlondon.com/liveable-streets-case-for-reversal-tower-hamlets/) that shows both sides of the argument and tries to find solutions to local issues. 

‘We are still very small - just four core staff - but as a team we’re all very passionate about the importance of local journalism in terms of improving local democracy, supporting the local economy and unifying the local community.’ 

With 10,000 copies of _The Slice_ available, you can pick up a magazine at all the Idea Stores in Tower Hamlets as well as cultural and community centres such as Rich Mix, Brady Centre, Stepney City Farm, Genesis, and Poplar Union. Most cafes along Roman Road will also have copies so you can pick up _The Slice_ next time you pop in for a coffee.
