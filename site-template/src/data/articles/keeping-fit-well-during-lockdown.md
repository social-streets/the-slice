description: "Our guide to the best local fitness, yoga and mindfulness classes during lockdown, including ways to get creative and stay busy with useful tips and courses."
---

Times are tough right now. And the more vulnerable among us are largely stuck in our homes and may feel isolated. So it is important that we lean on each other, and _yourself_ as well.

Staying fit and well while stuck at home can seem challenging at first. With your [favourite local yoga studios](https://romanroadlondon.com/best-yoga-classes-bow-globe-town/), gyms and mindfulness centres closing for now, you might feel like giving up on exercising and the hobbies you used to enjoy.

Luckily, our wonderful community has shown itself to be incredibly adaptable. Fitness classes, yoga sessions and even art classes are now being streamed over Zoom, which can help you feel a little more connected while physically isolated.

Here's our guide to safeguarding your physical and mental wellbeing during lockdown.
